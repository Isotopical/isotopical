Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my three sons!

# My Three Sons

This 2020 spotlight is on my three sons, one of which is biological and the other two are my stepsons. They make a huge impact on me. Not only did they have a huge impact on me this year, but they're also one of the reasons that I do what I do.

I work really hard to be a good example for them, but also provide for them the kind of childhood that that I had; well taken care of protected and everything like that. And I work well with with my stepsons mother and their father as well to make all that happen.

So I just want to do a shout out and a spotlight on on those three boys. Because they are my inspiration. They are just a great encouragement in my day to day but especially here in 2020.
