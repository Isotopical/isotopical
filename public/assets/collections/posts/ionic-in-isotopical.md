In [my last article](/posts/intro-to-isotopical) on [Isotopical](https://www.isotopical.website), I introduced you my take on a pseudo content management system I wrote that powers this website. In this article I'll be going into more detail about the user interface framework I chose for this project, [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com). As I wanted to take a mobile first approach in the project, while also fully supporting desktop browsers, Ionic was a natural choice.

# Let There Be Ionic

Ben Sperry and Max Lynch founded a company named Drifty Co. and they created a tool named Codiqa. This was a mockup drag-and-drop tool to build jQuery Mobile apps. Back in the day, jQuery Mobile was a pretty good solution for building mobile UIs for web apps. I've used jQuery and its mobile counterpart many times in the past. As it grew in features, it started to become sluggish and bloated. I'm sure by now they have solved many of the issues that caused it to be slow. However, back then, this led me to Ben and Max's next project.

In 2012, Drifty Co. founded and released an early preview of Ionic Framework. Back then it leveraged AngularJS to handle business logic and render the UI components the end user would interact with. AngularJS redefined how web apps were built and solved the performance issues that troubled jQuery Mobile. So it was a natural choice for the early versions of Ionic. It was a such a great choice in fact that it is likely the reason there was massive adoption and positive reception to this new kid on the block.

I don't know much more about the history of Drifty Co. and Ionic Framework prior to my use of Ionic. I've been using it since version 1. I have friends who have been using it since its preview versions.
