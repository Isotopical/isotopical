Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my friend, Mike Hurst!

# Mike Hurst

This 2020 Spotlight is one of the many Mikes that I have in my life. This particular Mike was a sounding board for me this year and gave me somebody to talk to when there were some tough times, especially during the virus and everything. And he also brought me some things to my house while I was on lockdown. So I greatly appreciate that. 

This December we're also going to be spending a couple weeks together on a trip to Disney, Universal and some of the other places within Florida. We're looking forward to it. There'll be a lot of firsts on this trip. First time, parasailing first time on a jetski things like that will be taking place. It'll be nice to finish off the year with some relaxing time and some good times with a great friend.

So Mike, thank you so much for being a part of my year and making such a positive impact on me.
