My Vue on Ionic

<!--more-->

# Initial Impression

When I first looked into VueJS, I was not impressed. I come from years of implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern of software development. This pattern enforces a separation of the data, the user interface and experience, and the business logic that ties all of it together. Modern web frameworks such as Angular use MVC quite well. However, looking at examples of VueJS code, I quickly saw that it adopts a different approach to separation of concerns.
