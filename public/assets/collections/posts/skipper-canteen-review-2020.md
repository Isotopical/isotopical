One of the more entertaining attractions I have enjoyed at the Walt Disney World Resort is the Jungle Cruise in Adventureland at the Magic Kingdom park. As you disembark on your journey, your Jungle Cruise skipper navigates a boat along the course of a river and points out the many wonderful things to see throughout your tour. It is most known for the many puns the skippers tell while you enjoy experience. After being on the cruise for Niles and Niles, a great place to get some quality food and continue to humor, I recommend the [Jungle Navigation Co.

# A Long Hiatus

In April 2018, I made my first trip to Florida in over 6 years. It had certainly been far too long since my last visit. Regardless of how much time between visits or how often I do make it to the Walt Disney World Resort, when I make my way through the gates at the Magic Kingdom, a breath of relief comes across my chest and I say those magical words, "I'm home!"

I went another time in 2018 when I got married there and spent my honeymoon at the parks. Then in 2019, I purchased an Annual Pass and went on 6 trips that year.One traditional ceremony I perform each time is I'll walk down Main Street USA and snap a new photo of Cinderella's castle. You might be thinking that it seems redundant to snap such a picture each time. You would be quite wrong.

Something else I love to do any time I journey the most magical place on Earth is try something new. Some times this would be a new attraction, as was the case in [my most recent visit](/posts/return-to-wdw) when I returned after the CoVid-19 closure. Other times, mostly because new attractions do not open very often, I decide to try a new restaurant. On that April 2018 trip, I did ride a few new attractions I had not been on. However, the thing I most looked forward to trying for the first time was the Skipper Canteen.

# Not All Puns are Created Equal

You may have noticed the pun in the intro paragraph above. One of the best parts of the Jungle Cruise is the constant jokes and puns from the skippers. However, this attraction has not always been so punny! In the begin, Jungle Cruise was quite a serious ride through the exotic. But legend as it that one skipper spiced up his tour a bit by telling jokes along the way. When Walt Disney heard about this, he was intrigued and wanted to hear this for himself. When this skipper noticed he had Walt on his boat, he went back to the standard script.

The legend continues when Walt boarded this skipper's boat once more incognito. As the skipper did not realize the father of this magical world was not on board, the skipper kept with his whimsical joke telling this time. The legend concludes that Walt loved this so much that he completely re-imagined the scripts and jokes and puns have been told on this world famous attraction ever since.

When I decided to enjoy dinner at the Skipper Canteen restaurant, I fully expected the same sort of experience. I was greatly disappointed. There wasn't a single joke or pun spoken from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. Everyone seemed just as wonderful as anywhere else on the Walt Disney World Resort property. However, it did not have the slightest resemblance to the Jungle Cruise with the exception of some of the decor. The food was also quite disappointing for the price. It simply did not live up to its name or the reputation of any table service restaurant I had been to at the resort.

# Second Chance

Fast forward 2 years and the world is overrun by the CoVid-19 pandemic for the first time in 100 years. Things get so bad that the Walt Disney World Resort, along with most of the world, is shutdown temporarily. Once the parks reopened, the plans to return to the parks began. My chance to get back was the last weekend of August into the first week of September. There is no need to rehash how crazy 2020 is. We were all affected by it. It certainly taught me what is and isn't important. One of the most important things in life is a second chance. And as silly as it may sound, I felt Skipper Canteen needed a second chance from me.

So with dinner reservations made and expectations at a much lower level, I was looking forward to a new experience with this now staple restaurant at the Magic Kingdom. Would there be jokes and puns? I was hoping so. Would there be wonderful food? Again, I was hoping so. I am quite happy to report that the jokes and puns were being thrown around and the food was far better than I could have ever imagined.
