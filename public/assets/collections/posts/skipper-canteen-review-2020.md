One of the more entertaining attractions I have enjoyed at the Walt Disney World Resort is the Jungle Cruise in Adventureland at the Magic Kingdom park. As you disembark on your journey, your Jungle Cruise skipper navigates a boat along the course of a river and points out the many wonderful things to see throughout your tour. It is most known for the many puns the skippers tell while you enjoy the experience. After being on the cruise for "Niles and Niles", a great place to get some quality food and continue the humor, I recommend the [Jungle Navigation Co.

# A Long Hiatus

In April 2018, I made my first trip to Florida in over 6 years. It had certainly been far too long since my last visit. Regardless of how much time between visits or how often I do get to visit the Walt Disney World Resort, when I make my way through the gates at the Magic Kingdom, a breath of relief comes across my chest and I say those magical words, "I'm home!"

I went a second time in 2018 when I got married there and spent my honeymoon at the parks. Then in 2019, I purchased an Annual Pass and went on 6 trips that year.One traditional ceremony I perform each time is I'll walk down Main Street USA and snap a new photo of Cinderella's castle. You might be thinking that it seems redundant to snap such a picture each time. You would be quite wrong.

Something else I love to do any time I journey to the most magical place on Earth is try something new. Sometimes this would be a new attraction, as was the case in [my most recent visit](/posts/return-to-wdw) as I returned after the CoVid-19 closure. Other times, mostly because new attractions do not open very often, I decide to try a new restaurant. On that April 2018 trip, I did ride a few new attractions I had not been on. However, the thing I most looked forward to trying for the first time was the Skipper Canteen.

# Not All Puns are Created Equal

You may have noticed the pun in the intro paragraph above. One of the best parts of the Jungle Cruise is the constant jokes and puns from the skippers. However, this attraction has not always been so punny! In the begin, Jungle Cruise was quite a serious ride through the exotic. But legend has it that one skipper spiced up his tour a bit by telling jokes along the way. When Walt Disney heard about this, he was intrigued and wanted to hear this for himself. When the skipper noticed he had Walt on his boat, he went back to the standard script.

The legend continues when Walt boarded this skipper's boat once more incognito. As the skipper did not realize the creator of this magical world was on board again, the skipper kept with his whimsical joke telling this time. The legend concludes that Walt loved this so much that he completely re-imagined the scripts. Jokes and puns have been told on this world famous attraction ever since.

When I decided to enjoy dinner at the Skipper Canteen restaurant, I fully expected the same sort of experience. I was greatly disappointed. There wasn't a single joke or pun spoken from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. Everyone seemed just as wonderful as anywhere else on the Walt Disney World Resort property. However, it did not have the slightest resemblance to the Jungle Cruise with the exception of some of the decor. The food was also quite disappointing for the price. It simply did not live up to its name or the reputation of any table service restaurant I had been to at the resort.

# Second Chance

Fast forward 2 years and the world is overrun by a pandemic for the first time in 100 years. Things get so bad that the Walt Disney World Resort, along with most of the world, is shutdown temporarily. Once the parks reopened, the plans to return to the parks began. My chance to get back was the last weekend of August into the first week of September. There is no need to rehash how crazy 2020 is. We were all affected by it. It certainly taught me what is and isn't important. One of the most important things in life is a second chance. And as silly as it may sound, I felt Skipper Canteen needed a second chance from me.

So with dinner reservations made and expectations at a much lower level, I was looking forward to a new experience with this now staple restaurant at the Magic Kingdom. Would there be jokes and puns? I was hoping so. Would there be wonderful food? Again, I was hoping so. I am quite happy to report that the jokes and puns were being thrown around and the food was far better than I could have ever imagined.

## New Puns

![Dining in the Skipper Canteen](/assets/img/collections/posts/skipper-canteen-review-2020/skipper-canteen-review-2020-2.jpg "Dining in the Skipper Canteen")

One of the first things I noticed this time was the jokes and puns. There were plenty! And on top of that, they were all ones I had not heard before. They came up with quips that are not used on the Jungle Cruise attraction and accented those things unique to the restaurant that aren't on the boat tour. For example, in the photograph above you will notice the chandelier. Our waiter was sure to point it out as one of the "high lights" of the restaurant.

## Great Drinks

The Disney Company does a great job at making adults feel like kids again with the fully immersive experiences of there many world renowned attractions. But they also do a great job at making us feel like adults with a fantastic drink selection. The pre-dinner cocktails my wife and I enjoyed were House-made Sangrias. We had the choice between white or red wines and each was blended with spices and juice from a small variety of fruit. For dinner, I enjoyed a Kungaloosh Spiced Excursion Ale. This is an African inspired deep amber ale that is exclusively brewed for Walt Disney World.

## Not So Secret Appetizer

One of the fun parts of the Skipper Canteen this time was the "Not So Secret Menu." I'm not quite sure if this existed in April 2018. But I'm sure glad it exists now! On that menu this time was something called Pao de Queijo. Roughly translated, it is Brazilian (Portuguese) for really super awesome cheese bread with the sauce from Heaven! Now to translated my embellishment, this is a gluten-free Brazilian cheese bread paired with chimichurri surrounded by a cream cheese chimichurri sauce. The cheese is worked into the bread as opposed to being in a pocket of sorts. To call this a great appetizer says nothing. This is by far the best appetizer that has graced my lips! This was not on the regular menu. So if you go, be sure to ask for this Not So Secret Appetizer by name.

## Curried Vegetable Crew Stew

Whether you are a vegetarian or you just enjoy some of the finer things that come from the exotic subcontinent of India, the Skipper Canteen serves a fantastic stew. The Curried Vegetable Crew Stew to be exact. This favorite of the Crew Stew Crew, especially Stu, is a seasoned vegetable and pineapple tofu dish in a house-made curry sauce with coconut rice. All of this with a piece of Naan that simply melts in your mouth. Although I was able to sample this delightful arrangement of flavors, this is the entree of choice made by my bride. She did let me finish it off after she was done with it, though.

## Sustainable Fish

This "Not Piranha", as they call it, is served atop a cassava cake with wilted greens and a guava-habanero sauce. The fish in this entree is raised on property at the Walt Disney World Resort. Despite the sound of that, this fish tastes every bit as good as one caught fresh in the sea. The cassava cake was a fluffy and surprising Filipino delight that went quite well with the fish flavor. The wilted greens and guava-habanero sauce were the perfect crescendo to ignite the fireworks going off in my mouth as I ate each bite.

## Kungaloosh!

Although the Skipper Canteen has multiple desserts, you really need to try the Kungaloosh! This is an African inspired masterpiece of chocolate cake with a caramelized banana slice. It is served with a cashew-caramel ice cream topped with a crunchy coffee dust cookie. I had to have this with a hot cup of coffee. The coffee really brought out the flavors in every bite. If you aren't a coffee drinker, you will still enjoy this dessert. And just as with the fine aforementioned ale, this Kungaloosh has a name that fully describes just how fabulously fun this tastes!

# Second Time's the Charm

I was pleasantly surprised at just how much the Jungle Navigation Co. LTD Skipper Canteen improved over the last 2 years. It was a lesson in great humor and food as well as a great lesson in giving a second chance. I really don't know if they were having an off night in 2018 or things really have improved that much. Regardless, I'm sure glad I went back this time. It may not be the "Eighth Wonder of the World" behind the beautiful Schweitzer Falls, named after that famous African explorer, Dr. Albert Falls. But it truly is an amazing dining experience that is definitely more exciting than "the back side of water."
