Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my parents, Mike and Kathy!

This past summer, my wife's family had contracted the COVID virus, and it spread through them like wildfire. Part of that my wife was called upon to take care of her grandparents and one of her aunts, to bring them back to health. And in the process, she contracted the virus as well. Unfortunately, one of her uncles and grandfather passed away from the virus.

This whole time she stayed with them and when she came home, I put her in quarantine as to protect myself and her children. I implemented a rigorous cleaning process and wearing of masks. She was quarantined by herself and I only went in there when it was necessary. But as a part of that, I also wanted to make sure not to spread it to the community around me, so I stay at home.

In order to make that work, my parents volunteered to do the grocery shopping for us. To reduce the amount of times they had to go to the store I basically gave them a huge shopping list. We have a family of four that live here. They took a picture of Dad with the shopping cart being full and it was definitely more of the positive attitude that they had about the process.

When they brought the groceries home to me, they put them into basically containers. After they were done filling the containers, I brought all that stuff in. So there was no contact with them whatsoever. They were also safe. I want to just highlight and spotlight and thank them so much for the positive impact that they made on us this year, and helping us get through it.

My wife survived. She does have some lingering effects after the fact that she'll have to deal with the rest of her life. But she is alive. And because of what my parents did, we also prevented the spread of it from outside of our house, and the rest of us are doing well.

So thank you mom and dad and I look forward to doing the next 2020 Spotlight.
