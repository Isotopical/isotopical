It probably goes without saying, 2020 has been a rough year. So rough, many modern economic staples came to a complete halt. One such staple that is near and dear to me is the Walt Disney World Resort. Not only does it bring back childhood memories, it is a special place to me as an adult. I can go there and forget about the rest of my world and its trouble. And this is a year when I needed it most. Now that WDW is open once again, I finally had the opportunity to experience the magic once again.

# Closing the Kingdom

In the last few months of 2019, the world was introduced to a coronavirus that became most known as CoVid-19. Due to modern traveling methods, this virus quickly spread across the globe. What started as an epidemic in a few regions of the world grew into a global scale pandemic. Many countries called for the closing of businesses and restricted the size of crowds in public venues. One of the largest businesses in the world that was most affected by this was DisneyParks. Eventually, all of the Disney theme parks closed, beginning with Shanghai Disneyland in January.

The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida has been closed in the past for six hurricanes and after the 9/11 attacks on the USA in 2001. However, when the gates closed on March 15, 2020, they would remain closed for months. Never in the history of the Florida Disney theme parks had any of them ever closed for more than a few days. For many, such as myself, this was devastating. I go so often I have an Annual Pass. In fact, I had gone six times in 2019 alone and even got married there. Disney runs through my veins and not being able to visit my happiest place on Earth was quite difficult.

In the uncertainty of how the world was going to deal with this highly contagious and rapidly spreading virus, it was hard to know when Disney World would reopen. They had to send the international Cast Members back to their home countries and ultimately furloughed a majority of their park Cast. The annual Flower and Garden was cut short and all of the college program participants were sent home. Not only did this cast a dark cloud over the Disney World kingdom, it seemed as though the magic was all but lost.

# Restarting the Magic

I do not recall where I was when I heard the good news of Walt Disney World reopening. I really only recall having a thousand questions about what it would now be like. Information coming out of the central Florida oasis was changing daily. The only thing that seemed to be certain was that the Magic Kingdom & Disney's Animal Kingdom would open on 7/11/2020 and EPCOT & Disney's Hollywood Studios would open on 7/15/2020. They also extended the expiration date for all Annual Pass (AP) holders more than once to help those guests retain the value of their memberships.

In order to best control the number of guests allowed in the parks, they implemented a reservation system by which an AP or day pass holder may reserve their entry into the park the day, or days, they would like to visit. There were only a limited number of available reservations each day as to ensure a safe number of guests and reduce the likelihood of spreading the virus.

There are a number of other enhancements being implemented that I will go over from my personal experience below. Needless to say, all of this could not have been easy for any part of the Walt Disney Company. I suppose the only part of the global entertainment giant that has not felt the negative effects of CoVid-19 is Disney's newest venture, the Disney+ video streaming service. I for one am quite grateful they introduced Disney+ before the pandemic. It helped keep the magic alive for me and prepare me for my return to the Walt Disney World Resort.

# My Return and the 4 Keys

I made my first trip after the reopening of the Walt Disney World Resort on 8/30/2020 and was there through 9/1/2020. It was a short trip. But a much needed break from the events of the year. I expected some of the magic to be gone. But I was pleasantly surprised by the magic that remained. There were also some unexpected changes that truly enhanced the visit. I'll present some of what I experienced by dividing into Walt Disney's 4 Keys. To read about the 4 keys in more detail, and how they can be applied to software development, I recommend [Walt Disney's Four Keys (Of Software Development)](https://walkingriver.com/four-keys/) by my good friend [Michael Callaghan](https://twitter.com/walkingriver).

## Safety

The first, and most important, key is Safety. In a world where a pandemic is still active with a virus spreading and mutating, safety is quite a tall task. The most obvious safety measure they have taken is requiring masks be worn at all times on property with the exception of inside guest rooms or while eating and drinking. This policy goes for all Cast and guests. They take this seriously enough that I was promptly asked to put my mask back on when I attempted to take a selfie in front of Cinderella's castle without a mask.

Above, I mentioned there were a limited number of available reservations for park admission. Because of lower guest numbers, another safety protocol Walt Disney World was able to implement was social distancing in queue lines for their many attractions. There are ground markers every six feet and signs everywhere indicating how to keep distance between all social groups. There were a few times where this was a bit confusing. However, it was mostly easy to follow. The only real confusion was due to large caps between some of the ground markers. It appeared that these gaps existed because of areas where more distance was required. Besides these markers, there were also areas where physical barriers were erected where it was not possible to maintain a good amount of distance.

As you can imagine, with several guests touching rails and attraction vehicles throughout the day, Disney needed a way to manage and reduce cross contamination. One way they achieved this was providing hand sanitizer and hand washing stations throughout. This included before and after rides, and at all counter locations such as in guest relations and restaurants. Along with the hand sanitizer, the attractions were frequently paused for cleaning. This occurred a few times while I was in a queue line. I also saw Cast frequently wiping down railings and counter surfaces through the day.

## Courtesy

I for one cannot imagine working for Disney Parks and suddenly no longer being able to help guests enjoy the magic. And on top of that, being furloughed for months with the uncertainty of not knowing when you would be able to return to the most magical job on Earth. Sure, there was an unemployment benefit of $600 per week from the federal government. However, not everyone would necessarily qualify for a variety of reasons and a benefit like that has an expiration date. I cannot imagine the stress caused by not knowing how long any of this would last. And should they look for another job or hold out for Disney Parks opening again?

Thankfully, the parks at Walt Disney World did open and some of the Cast were welcomed back to their jobs. With limited numbers of guests, I believe not everyone was able to return. However, all of them who were able to get back to work and were working during my visit had smiles on their faces. In fact, a majority of them appeared to have extra large smiles behind their masks and welcomed me back to the magic as if they knew I go often and missed being there this year!

A few of the Cast really stood out during my visit and represented Disney's second key, Courtesy, quite well. Mary, Yvelissa, and Jodi are three of those who really made a difference for this return visit. Mary and Yvelissa both worked at the Primo Piatto restaurant at Disney's Riviera resort hotel. They were both quite helpful in answering a few questions for me and providing me a nice refreshing beverage. Jodi worked at the Coral Reef Restaurant in EPCOT and was able to get me in without a reservation just before they closed for the day.

## Show

Before planning my visit back to Walt Disney World, I really struggled with the thought I would not see any firework shows or parades. I knew I would also miss the street performances that seemed to randomly pop up before. I was actually reluctant to return to Disney before they planned to start up the shows again. I even let my Annual Pass expire before I planned this trip. I just did not feel I would want to frequently visit the parks for a few years, not due to the risks of CoVid-19 exposure, but primarily due to changes caused by the virus.

Despite my reluctancy, I did end up planning a quick trip to see the changes for myself. Just getting to see the castle at the Magic Kingdom would be worth it in a year that is filled with chaos. Since they updated the paint on the castle, I was definitely looking forward to seeing it again. I have read mixed reviews on the new color scheme. I personally love it and feel it exemplifies Show, Disney's third key.

Although many of the usual shows and performances are currently on hold, there were a few shows that I enjoyed. The Disney Society Orchestra is performing in the Theater of the Stars at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. This sextet masterpiece of a group plays many classic Disney songs and are truly the bees knees. At EPCOT, Marimba de Las Américas and JAMMitors perform in the American pavilion. I did not get to see JAMMitors, but did have the opportunity to enjoy Marimba de Las Américas. This mariachi style ensemble was quite lively indeed!

## Efficiency

Efficiency is the forth and final of Disney's keys. This does not mean it is the least of the four. In fact, Disney seems to put in a lot of effort to make everything as efficient as possible and the other three keys benefit greatly from this as observed by this fan. From transportation schedules to software controls, the Walt Disney World Resort has a lot of cogs that have to keep working in order to keep things moving.

The [My Disney Experience](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/) app makes it easy to plan and manage your visit to the resort. Not only is it a website, there is also a [mobile app](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/mobile-apps/) you can download to your mobile device. One of the best features of MDE is the mobile ordering of food at the Quick Service restaurants throughout the parks. Actually, it is currently the only way to order food at those restaurants that do not offer reservations, or Table Service.

I started using this feature last year and I for one feel this is a much more efficient way to order those quick meals as it allows my family to choose what they would like and I can go pick up the food once it is ready. Now that it is required for the Quick Service restaurants, it reduces the number of people in the service areas where they hand you the food. The way Disney handles this reminds me of curbside pickup at restaurants back home. Once I had my food, I was able to quickly find a table where I could eat and was a safe distance from any other tables that were occupied.

# A Trip of Firsts

I was invited to the Pass Holder Preview for Galaxy's Edge in August of 2019. This is the Star Wars themed area of Disney's Hollywood Studios where you can immerse yourself in a new planet named Batuu. At the time, only the Smuggler's Run attraction was open in terms of themed rides. A few months before the shutdown, Rise of the Resistance opened. I originally planned to be there the week that attraction opened. Alas, I had to cancel those plans. Due to the pandemic, I did not get another chance until this trip.

Rise of the Resistance is by far one of the most advanced attractions in all of the four parks at the Walt Disney World Resort. As this is a new attraction, and as of this writing, you have to sign up for a boarding party; which are only open to request at park opening and 2pm. The available groups go quickly too. I was not able to secure a group at the 10am lottery. At the 2pm lottery, I secured a backup group. At 5:24pm, I got word that I would be able to ride. I did not look up any details prior to the visit because I wanted to experience it fresh. In that spirit, I have decided not to go into details concerning the full experience of Rise of the Resistance. But I highly recommend this amazing attraction!

The week Walt Disney World closed, another new attraction opened. Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway takes you into the cartoon world of, you guessed it, Mickey and Minnie. This is the first attraction to feature these iconic characters and showcases the whimsy that has existed in Disney's feature cartoons since [Steamboat Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie) in 1928. Even though my wait was short to ride, I can honestly say I could wait up to 90 minutes for this railway ride and still feel it is worth the wait. I absolutely loved it. Just as with Rise of the Resistance, I did not look up details nor will I share them here. It is something you just have to experience for yourself!

# Tips

While I was on this brief trip, I collected some thoughts about tips and advice I would like to share with anyone interested in planning a visit. I typically look at any help as a good thing. So I hope to be as helpful as possible. It is important to stay safe while having a good time. I was able to achieve both and here are the tips I have to offer.

- Wear a comfortable mask. You have to be wearing one everywhere you go on property except in your room, when eating and drinking while stationary, and designated relaxing stations.
- Take multiple masks. It is a good idea to have a backup mask while at the parks. But I also found that changing masks each day was a good idea regardless.
- There are hand sanitizing and washing stations everywhere. I highly recommend using them as often as possible. Especially after you enjoy an attraction and definitely before ever touching your face.
- The Quick Service restaurants are quite efficient at preparing your order. I was able to order my food while just outside the restaurant and immediately click the "I am here" button. I would recommend taking advantage of this truly quick service before the limits on number of guests increases in the future.
- While in the queue line for each attraction, I paid close attention to the social distancing markers. In fact, I stepped on each to ensure I was properly pacing with those in front of and behind me while the line was moving.
- Speaking of social distancing markers, pay close attention to when there are gaps larger than 6 feet. These areas appear to be spaced extra due to how the queue lines sometimes wrap back and forth.
- Be prepared to have your temperature taken. Since I wear hats, I took my hat off as I approached the vestibule where they were taking readings. Being ready helps make the line go much faster.
- Take in all of the shows you can. Since they do not currently have fireworks shows or street performances, stopping to enjoy the few shows that are still available made for a more enjoying visit for me.
- Be patient! If you find yourself in a slow moving line or a situation that isn't so magical, patience is key. The entire world is feeling the stress of this pandemic. Other guests and the Cast are experiencing their own situations that feel so "2020."
- If you are bald like me, wear a hat.

# Closing Thoughts

The CoVid-19 related changes are unlikely to scale as Walt Disney World increases the limits on number of guests in the parks. However, it is everyone's hope that the threat of being infected by the virus will decrease. I am so glad I decided to make this trip to the Walt Disney World Resort. Now is a great time to go. All wait times are quite short and the Cast seem very glad to have guests once more. They are running various money saving deals to help make it easy to visit. There are new attractions and many of my favorites appeared to have had much needed repairs. I am already planning my next visit so I can continue taking advantage of lower guest attendance. If you have been unsure about getting back, I encourage you to go ahead and make plans. You will be glad you did!
