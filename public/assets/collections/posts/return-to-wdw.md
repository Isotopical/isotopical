It probably goes without saying, 2020 has been a rough year. So rough, many modern economic staples came to a complete halt. One such staple that is near and dear to me is the Walt Disney World Resort. Not only does it bring back childhood memories, it is a special place to me as an adult. I can go there and forget about the rest of my world and its trouble. And this is a year when I needed it most. Now that WDW is open once again, I finally had the opportunity to experience the magic once again.

# Closing the Kingdom

In the last few months of 2019, the world was introduced to a coronavirus that became most known as CoVid-19. Due to modern traveling methods, this virus quickly spread across the globe. What started as an epidemic in a few regions of the world grew into a global scale pandemic. Many countries called for the closing of businesses and restricted the size of crowds in public venues. One of the largest businesses in the world that was most affected by this was DisneyParks. Eventually, all of the Disney theme parks closed, beginning with Shanghai Disneyland in January.

The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida was closed for six hurricanes and after the 9/11 attacks on the USA in 2001. However, when the gates closed on March 15, 2020, they would remain closed for months. Never in the history of the Florida Disney theme parks had any of them ever closed for more than a few days. For many, such as myself, this was devastating. I go so often I have an Annual Pass. In fact, I had gone six times in 2019 alone and even got married there. Disney runs through my veins and not being able to visit my happiest place on Earth was quite difficult.

In the uncertainty of how the world was going to deal with this highly contagious and rapidly spreading virus, it was hard to know when Disney World would reopen. They had to send the international Cast Members back to their home countries and ultimately furloughed a majority of their park Cast. The annual Flower and Garden was cut short and all of the college program participants were sent home. Not only did this cast a dark cloud over the Disney World kingdom, it seemed as though the magic was all but lost.

# Restarting the Magic

I do not recall where I was when I heard the good news of Walt Disney World reopening. I really only recall having a thousand questions about what it would now be like. Information coming out of the central Florida oasis was changing daily. The only thing that seemed to be certain was that the Magic Kingdom & Disney's Animal Kingdom would open on 7/11/2020 and EPCOT & Disney's Hollywood Studios would open on 7/15/2020. They also extended the expiration date for all Annual Pass (AP) holders more than once to help those guests retain the value of their memberships.

In order to best control the number of guests allowed in the parks, they implemented a reservation system by which an AP or day pass holder may reserve their entry into the park the day, or days, they would like to visit. There were only a limited number of available reservations each day as to ensure a safe number of guests and reduce the likelihood of continued spread of the virus.

There are a number of other enhancements being implemented that I will go over from my personal experience below. Needless to say, all of this could not have been easy for any part of the Walt Disney Company. I suppose the only part of the global entertainment giant that has not felt the negative effects of CoVid-19 is Disney's newest venture, the Disney+ video streaming service. I for one am quite grateful they introduced Disney+ before the pandemic. It helped keep the magic alive for me and prepare me for my return to the Walt Disney World Resort.

# My Return and the 4 Keys

I made my first trip after the reopening of the Walt Disney World Resort on 8/30/2020 and was there through 9/1/2020. It was a short trip. But a much needed break from the events of the year. I expected some of the magic to be gone. But I was pleasantly surprised by the magic that remained. There were also some unexpected changes that truly enhanced the visit. I'll present some of what I experienced by dividing into Walt Disney's 4 Keys. To read about the 4 keys in more detail, and how they can be applied to software development, I recommend [Walt Disney's Four Keys (Of Software Development)](https://walkingriver.com/four-keys/) by my good friend Michael Callaghan.

## Safety

The first, and most important, key is Safety. In a world where a pandemic is still active with a virus spreading and mutating, safety is quite a tall task. The most obvious safety measure they have taken is requiring masks be worn at all times on property with the exception of inside guest rooms or while eating and drinking while remaining stationary. This policy goes for all Cast and guests. They take this seriously enough that we were promptly asked to put our masks back on when we attempted to take a selfie in front of Cinderella's castle without our masks.

Above, I mentioned there were a limited number of available reservations for park admission. Because of lower guest numbers, another safety protocol Walt Disney World was able to implement was social distancing in queue lines for their many attractions. There are ground markers every six feet and signs everywhere indicating how to keep distance between all social groups. There were a few times where this was a bit confusing. However, it was mostly easy to follow. The only real confusion was due to large caps between some of the ground markers. It appeared that these gaps existed because of areas where more distance was required. Besides these markers, there were also areas where physical barriers were erected where it was not possible to maintain a good amount of distance.

As you can imagine, with several guests touching rails and attractions throughout the day, Disney needed a way to manage and reduce cross contamination. One way they achieved this was providing hand sanitizer throughout. This included before and after rides, and at all counter locations such as in guest relations and restaurants. Along with the hand sanitizer, the attractions were frequently paused for cleaning. This occurred a few times while I was in a queue line. I also so Cast frequently wiping down railings and counter surfaces through the day.

## Courtesy

I for one cannot imagine working for Disney Parks and suddenly no longer being able to help guests enjoy the magic. And on top of that, being furloughed for months with the uncertainty of not knowing when you would be able to return to the most magical job on Earth. Sure, there was an unemployment benefit of $600 per week from the federal government. However, not everyone would necessarily qualify for a variety of reasons and a benefit like that has an expiration date. I cannot imagine the stress of not knowing how long anything would last would cause. And should they look for another job or hold out for Disney Parks opening again?

Thankfully, the parks at Walt Disney World did open and some of the Cast were welcomed back to their jobs. With limited numbers of guests, I believe not everyone was able to return. However, all of them who were able to return and were working during my visit had smiles on their faces. In fact, a majority of them appeared to have extra large smiles and welcomed me back to the magic as if they knew I go often and missed being there this year!

A few of the Cast really stood out during my visit and represented Disney's second key, Courtesy, quite well. Mary, Yvelissa, and Jodi are three of those who really made a difference for this return visit. Mary and Yvelissa both worked at the Primo Piatto restaurant at Disney's Riviera resort hotel. They were both quite helpful in answer a few questions for me and providing me a nice refreshing beverage. Jodi worked at the Coral Reef Restaurant in EPCOT and was able to get me in without a reservation just before they closed for the day.

## Show

Before planning my visit back to Walt Disney World, I really struggled with the thought I would not see any firework shows or parades. I knew I would also miss the street performances that seemed to randomly pop up before. I was actually reluctant to return to Disney before they planned to start up the shows again. I even let my Annual Pass expire before I planned this trip. I just did not feel I would want to frequently visit the parks for a few years, not due to the risks of CoVid-19 exposure, but primarily due to changes caused by the virus.

Despite my reluctancy, I did end up planning a quick trip to see the changes for myself. Just getting to see the castle at the Magic Kingdom would be worth it in a year that is filled with chaos. Since they updated the paint on the castle, I was definitely looking forward to seeing it again. I have read mixed reviews on the new color scheme. I personally love it and feel it exemplifies Show, Disney's third key.

Although many of the usual shows and performances are currently on hold, there were a few shows that I enjoyed. The Disney Society Orchestra is performing in the Theater of the Stars at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. This sextet masterpiece of a group plays many classic Disney songs and are truly the bees knees. At EPCOT, Marimba de Las Américas and JAMMitors perform in the American pavilion. I did not get to see JAMMitors, but did have the opportunity to enjoy Marimba de Las Américas. This mariachi style ensemble was quite lively indeed!

## Efficiency

Efficiency is the forth and final of Disney's keys. This does not mean it is the least of the four. In fact, Disney seems to put in a lot of effort to make everything as efficient as possible and the other three keys benefit greatly from this as observed by this fan. From transportation schedules to software controls, the Walt Disney World Resort has a lot of cogs that have to keep working in order to keep things moving.

The [My Disney Experience](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/) app makes it easy to plan and manage your visit to the resort. Not only is it a website, there is also a [mobile app](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/mobile-apps/) you can download to your mobile device. One of the best features of MDE is the mobile ordering of food at the Quick Service restaurants throughout the parks. Actually, it is currently the only way to order food at those restaurants that do not offer reservations, or Table Service.

I started using this feature last year. I for one feel this is a much more efficient way to order those quick meals as it allows my family to choose what they would like and I can go pick up the food once it is ready. Now that it is required for the Quick Service restaurants, it reduces the number of people in the service area. They way Disney handles this reminds me of curbside pickup at restaurants back home. Once I had my food, I was able to quickly find a table to eat at that was a safe distance from any other tables that were occupied.

# A Trip of Firsts

I was invited to the Pass Holder Preview for Galaxy's Edge in August of 2019. This is the Star Wars themed area of Disney's Hollywood Studios where you can immerse yourself in a new planet named Batuu. At the time, only the Smuggler's Run attraction was open in terms of themed rides. A few months before the shutdown, Rise of the Resistance opened. I originally planned to be there the week that attraction opened. Alas, I had to cancel those plans. Due to the pandemic, I did not get another chance until this trip.

Rise of the Resistance is by far one of the most advanced attractions in all of the four parks at the Walt Disney World Resort. As this is a new attraction, and as of this writing, you have to sign up for a boarding party; which are only open to request at park opening and 2pm. The available groups go quickly too. I was not able to secure a group at the 10am lottery. At the 2pm lottery, I secured a backup group. At 5:24pm, I got word that I would able to ride. I did not look up any details prior to the visit because I wanted to experience it fresh. In that spirit, I have decided not to go into details concerning the full experience of Rise of the Resistance.

The week Walt Disney World closed, another new attraction opened. Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway takes you into the cartoon world of, you guessed it, Mickey and Minnie. This is the first attraction to feature these iconic characters and showcases the whimsy that has existed in Disney's feature cartoons since [Steamboat Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie) in 1928. Even though my wait was short to ride, I can honestly say I could wait up to 90 minutes for this railway ride. I absolutely loved it. Just as with Rise of the Resistance, I did not look up details nor will I share them here.

08/30 20:09
Later this week I’ll be writing about my experience with the reopening of the Walt Disney World Resort. I’m happy to be back at my happy place. Not everything felt magical. But everything seemed to hit their first key: Safety. Overall, I’m quite impressed.

 where he describes each and even shows how to apply them effectively in software development.

08/31 09:37
I’m headed to Disney’s Hollywood Studios today. I’m hoping to catch Rise of the Resistance and Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway.

08/31 10:18
I wasn’t able to secure a boarding pass for Rise of the Resistance for the morning groups and most people rushed to Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway. So I’m checking into the Hollywood Tower Hotel for some Terror

08/31 11:16
The scene in most areas at the Walt Disney World Resort parks feels like an off season day. This is nice but means less money coming in for them. On a positive note, they are doing a great job keep people separated. I’m able to dance in lines without hitting others

08/31 12:53
Bright Suns! It is a beautiful day in Black Spire on Batuu. I’m enjoying a Ronto Wrap. ‘Til the Spire!

08/31 13:25
25 min wait for Smugglers Run,  noice! One of the great things about Disney is the attention to detail. The sign appears to be decades old. But it is merely a few months after being printed Smirking face The third of Disney’s keys, Show.

08/31 15:07
After getting soaked by the rain, I’m enjoying lunch at Prime Time Cafe. I had “A Sampling of Mom's Favorite Recipes” and chased it down with a strawberry shake

08/31 16:03
I’m in line for this new attraction. The world shutdown the week this opened. I’m looking forward to checking it out!

08/31 16:59
The Disney Society Orchestra is the bees knees

08/31 17:24
On my way back to Batuu!!!

09/01 09:24
I’m heading to the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT, for the Food and Wine Festival. To get there, I’ll be riding the Skyliner. It is an efficient way to travel. A part of Disney’s fourth key: Efficiency

09/01 10:05
I stopped at Disney’s newest resort hotel, Disney’s Riviera for breakfast. One of the covid related enhancements they have made are better utensil dispensers. Now you don’t have to touch a lever to get what you need. Just pull the utensil you need!

09/01 10:29
While I complete my magical flight to EPCOT, I wanted to mention Disney’s second key: Courtesy. All Cast Members have welcomed us and helped make the covid enhancements an easy transition from pre-covid to what our world is today.

09/01 11:34
Great eats and great drinks are in my future

09/01 12:32
I got to see my favorite Disney character from Frozen, Olaf! One thing that isn’t frozen are the lines. They move at a comfortable pace. The only exception is when they stop the rides for cleaning. This has only happened to me a few times. Overall, everything is “walk on”

09/01 13:14
I’m trying out the newest restaurant at the American pavilion in EPCOT, the Regal Eagle Smokehouse. It is A Salute To All Cook-Offs * But Mostly Barbecue Rolling on the floor laughing I highly recommend the Spicy Mop sauce Smiling face

09/01 13:31
I performed on this stage 26 years ago. It was different back then. You could see Spaceship Earth behind me. I’m about to enjoy a mariachi band today. Shows are quite different now with the covid enhancements. I think different is good in this case

09/01 14:02
Now I’m enjoying a traditional Frozen Beer at the Japan Pavilion Smiling face with 3 hearts I’m glad to know not everything has changed

09/01 15:58
Now is a great to visit WDW. Buy a day pass or several days and come enjoy the parks! I’ll be writing about my experience in a few days. TL;DR is go! It is safe and you will have a magical time! RT please! Calling all Disney fans!

09/01 16:13
Great eats and great drinks at the Food and Wine Festival. Plenty of places to get out of the sun. You will not be disappointed 

09/01 17:35
Covid has certainly affected our lives. Some for the better and some for the worse. One place that has certainly handled things well is the Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida. It is a safe and still happy place. I cannot wait to share all of my thoughts.

If you are thinking about planning a trip, please do so! If you have plans, keep them. You will not be disappointed 

09/01 19:22
Thanks to my new friend Jodi, I was able to have dinner at The Coral Reef restaurant without a reservation. I absolutely love how the Cast goes out of their way to make a magical experience happen. Thank you Jodi!

09/02 08:41
Now it is time to say goodbye to the joy of the Walt Disney World Resort. I hope to be back real soon!
