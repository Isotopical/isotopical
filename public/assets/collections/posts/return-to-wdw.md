It probably goes without saying, 2020 has been a rough year. So rough, many modern economic staples came to a complete halt. One such staple that is near and dear to me is the Walt Disney World Resort. Not only does it bring back childhood memories, it is a special place to me as an adult. I can go there and forget about the rest of my world and its trouble. And this is a year when I needed it most. Now that WDW is open once again, I finally had the opportunity to experience the magic once again.

# Closing the Kingdom

In the last few months of 2019, the world was introduced to a coronavirus that became most known as CoVid-19. Due to modern traveling methods, this virus quickly spread across the globe. What started as an epidemic in a few regions of the world grew into a global scale pandemic. Many countries called for the closing of businesses and restricted the size of crowds in public venues. One of the largest businesses in the world that was most affected by this was DisneyParks. Eventually, all of the Disney theme parks closed, beginning with Shanghai Disneyland in January.

The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida was closed for six hurricanes and after the 9/11 attacks on the USA in 2001. However, when the gates closed on March 15, 2020, they would remain closed for months. Never in the history of the Florida Disney theme parks had any of them ever closed for more than a few days. For many, such as myself, this was devastating. I go so often I have an Annual Pass. In fact, I had gone six times in 2019 alone and even got married there. Disney runs through my veins and not being able to visit my happiest place on Earth was quite difficult.

In the uncertainty of how the world was going to deal with this highly contagious and rapidly spreading virus, it was hard to know when Disney World would reopen. They had to send the international Cast Members back to their home countries and ultimately furloughed a majority of their park Cast. The annual Flower and Garden was cut short and all of the college program participants were sent home. Not only did this cast a dark cloud over the Disney World kingdom, it seemed as though the magic was all but lost.

# Restarting the Magic

I do not recall where I was when I heard the good news of Walt Disney World reopening. I really only recall having a thousand questions about what it would now be like. Information coming out of the central Florida oasis was changing daily. The only thing that seemed to be certain was that the Magic Kingdom & Disney's Animal Kingdom would open on 7/11/2020 and EPCOT & Disney's Hollywood Studios would open on 7/15/2020. They also extended the expiration date for all Annual Pass (AP) holders more than once to help those guests retain the value of their memberships.

In order to best control the number of guests allowed in the parks, they implemented a reservation system by which an AP or day pass holder may reserve their entry into the park the day, or days, they would like to visit. There were only a limited number of available reservations each day as to ensure a safe number of guests and reduce the likelihood of continued spread of the virus.

There are a number of other enhancements being implemented that I will go over from my personal experience below. Needless to say, all of this could not have been easy for any part of the Walt Disney Company. I suppose the only part of the global entertainment giant that has not felt the negative effects of CoVid-19 is Disney's newest venture, the Disney+ video streaming service. I for one am quite grateful they introduced Disney+ before the pandemic. It helped keep the magic alive for me and prepare me for my return to the Walt Disney World Resort.

I arrived “home” this morning!!! I have missed this place. Last year I made 6 trips here. This is the first time in 2020 due to the pandemic. Today I’ll be at the Magic Kingdom Smiling face with 3 hearts

08/30 11:22
Having a great time at the Magic Kingdom!

Apparently wearing black socks with shorts and a t-shirt is frowned upon

Later this week I’ll be writing about my experience with the reopening of the Walt Disney World Resort. I’m happy to be back at my happy place. Not everything felt magical. But everything seemed to hit their first key: Safety. Overall, I’m quite impressed.

 where he describes each and even shows how to apply them effectively in software development.

I’m headed to Disney’s Hollywood Studios today. I’m hoping to catch Rise of the Resistance and Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway.

08/31 10:18
I wasn’t able to secure a boarding pass for Rise of the Resistance for the morning groups and most people rushed to Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway. So I’m checking into the Hollywood Tower Hotel for some Terror

08/31 11:16
The scene in most areas at the Walt Disney World Resort parks feels like an off season day. This is nice but means less money coming in for them. On a positive note, they are doing a great job keep people separated. I’m able to dance in lines without hitting others

08/31 12:53
Bright Suns! It is a beautiful day in Black Spire on Batuu. I’m enjoying a Ronto Wrap. ‘Til the Spire!

08/31 13:25
25 min wait for Smugglers Run,  noice! One of the great things about Disney is the attention to detail. The sign appears to be decades old. But it is merely a few months after being printed Smirking face The third of Disney’s keys, Show.

08/31 15:07
After getting soaked by the rain, I’m enjoying lunch at Prime Time Cafe. I had “A Sampling of Mom's Favorite Recipes” and chased it down with a strawberry shake

08/31 16:03
I’m in line for this new attraction. The world shutdown the week this opened. I’m looking forward to checking it out!

08/31 16:59
The Disney Society Orchestra is the bees knees

08/31 17:24
On my way back to Batuu!!!

09/01 09:24
I’m heading to the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT, for the Food and Wine Festival. To get there, I’ll be riding the Skyliner. It is an efficient way to travel. A part of Disney’s fourth key: Efficiency

09/01 10:05
I stopped at Disney’s newest resort hotel, Disney’s Riviera for breakfast. One of the covid related enhancements they have made are better utensil dispensers. Now you don’t have to touch a lever to get what you need. Just pull the utensil you need!

09/01 10:29
While I complete my magical flight to EPCOT, I wanted to mention Disney’s second key: Courtesy. All Cast Members have welcomed us and helped make the covid enhancements an easy transition from pre-covid to what our world is today.

09/01 11:34
Great eats and great drinks are in my future

09/01 12:32
I got to see my favorite Disney character from Frozen, Olaf! One thing that isn’t frozen are the lines. They move at a comfortable pace. The only exception is when they stop the rides for cleaning. This has only happened to me a few times. Overall, everything is “walk on”

09/01 13:14
I’m trying out the newest restaurant at the American pavilion in EPCOT, the Regal Eagle Smokehouse. It is A Salute To All Cook-Offs * But Mostly Barbecue Rolling on the floor laughing I highly recommend the Spicy Mop sauce Smiling face

09/01 13:31
I performed on this stage 26 years ago. It was different back then. You could see Spaceship Earth behind me. I’m about to enjoy a mariachi band today. Shows are quite different now with the covid enhancements. I think different is good in this case

09/01 14:02
Now I’m enjoying a traditional Frozen Beer at the Japan Pavilion Smiling face with 3 hearts I’m glad to know not everything has changed

09/01 15:58
Now is a great to visit WDW. Buy a day pass or several days and come enjoy the parks! I’ll be writing about my experience in a few days. TL;DR is go! It is safe and you will have a magical time! RT please! Calling all Disney fans!

09/01 16:13
Great eats and great drinks at the Food and Wine Festival. Plenty of places to get out of the sun. You will not be disappointed 

09/01 17:35
Covid has certainly affected our lives. Some for the better and some for the worse. One place that has certainly handled things well is the Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida. It is a safe and still happy place. I cannot wait to share all of my thoughts.

If you are thinking about planning a trip, please do so! If you have plans, keep them. You will not be disappointed 

09/01 19:22
Thanks to my new friend Jodi, I was able to have dinner at The Coral Reef restaurant without a reservation. I absolutely love how the Cast goes out of their way to make a magical experience happen. Thank you Jodi!

Now it is time to say goodbye to the joy of the Walt Disney World Resort. I hope to be back real soon!
