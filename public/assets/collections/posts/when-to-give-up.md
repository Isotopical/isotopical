Every single day I am faced with choices. The very first one is whether or not to get up once I wake. The last decision is typically when to go to bed. I can safely say, however, that the most difficult choice I face daily is when to give up. As a software developer, this will sometimes mean when I need to give up on a problem and take a break. But how does that relate to other circumstances?

# Reelin' in too Fast

One of the most wonderful scenes a grandmother could experience is seeing her husband, son, and grandson fishing side by side. As a child, I would often join my dad and grandpa in fishing trips to [Heritage Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Lake%2C_Indiana) in the wee hours of the morning. Eventually my grandparents moved to that lake and this made it incredibly easier for us to get up early and get out.

On one of these trips my uncles also joined us in search of [Grass Carp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_carp) that had been introduced into a feeder lake that spilled into Heritage Lake. As these were large fish, too large to be reeled in with conventional means, one of my uncles would shot them with a bow and arrow and I was tasked with grabbing them with a fish net. We didn't actually catch any that day. This was because I was off watching these majestic creatures come down the drain pipe from the feeder lake. They were just too beautiful to catch even though I could have just snatched them with the net as they came down.

On other visits to my grandparents house, I had one of those children's fishing poles with a Snoopy character on it. But like most children, it didn't take me long to get bored sitting there waiting for a fish to bite. One of the most vivid memories I have of fishing is a time when I began to reel the line in as fast as my little arm and hand could reel. As the end of the line approached the surface, guess who was following it? I'd say it was a nine or so inch bass!!! But with the speed I had built up, the bait was out of the water before he could catch up and so I lost the fish.

Had I not given up at the time, I would have more than likely caught that bass. Although it does make for a fond memory and great story, these two fish narratives paint two distinct pictures. One shows that sometimes it is good to stop and take a look at the beauty this world has to offer. The other shows that sometimes giving up too soon will show the prize that will be missed.

I was raised in the church. In fact, all but a few years of my life I even served in some capacity. The roots of faith grow deep in my family. When I was growing up, everyone in my great grand father's bloodline attended the same church. A lot has changed over the years at that church. Pastors have come and gone, the music has evolved, and only my parents remain.

After a failed attempt at running an Information Technology business in 2002, I joined a customer service team at the then third largest insurance company in the USA, Allstate. I originally signed on to be a claims representative in one of three Auto Express centers, ours being located in Indianapolis, Indiana.
