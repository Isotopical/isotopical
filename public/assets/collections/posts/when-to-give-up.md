Every single day I am faced with choices. The very first one is whether or not to get up once I wake. The last decision is typically when to go to bed. I can safely say, however, that the most difficult choice I face daily is when to give up. As a software developer, this will sometimes mean when I need to give up on a problem and take a break. But how does that relate to other circumstances?

# Reelin' in too Fast

One of the most wonderful scenes a grandmother could experience is seeing her husband, son, and grandson fishing side by side. As a child, I would often join my dad and grandpa in fishing trips to [Heritage Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Lake%2C_Indiana) in the wee hours of the morning. Eventually my grandparents moved to that lake and this made it incredibly easier for us to get up early and get out.

On one of these trips my uncles also joined us in search of [Grass Carp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_carp) that had been introduced into a feeder lake that spilled into Heritage Lake.

But like most children, it didn't take me long to get bored sitting there waiting for a fish to bite. One of the most vivid memories I have of fishing is a time when I was fishing with a Snoopy fishing pole and I got tired of waiting for those fish. I began to reel the line in as fast as my little arm and hand could reel. As the end of the line approached the surface, guess who was following it? I'd say it was a nine or so inch bass!!! But with the speed I had built up, the bait was out of the water before he could catch up and so I lost the fish.


Influences in my life...especially this year.
