# Greg Marine

> _"The reason adults should look as though they are having fun, is to give kids a reason to want to grow up."_ - Patch Adams

One of the things I have always told my son and step kids is _"You have to do the things you don't want to do so you can do the things you **DO** want to do."_ I'm not sure if that is wisdom or simply rhetoric. But something else they have heard me say often is _"I don't know a lot. But I know a lot about what I do know!"_ So, in honor of them and my desire for them to want to grow up, I dedicate this website to my son and step kids and to share the best of what I know and love.

# Walt Disney

> _We **keep moving forward**, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths._ - Walt Disney

I get a lot of inspiration from Walt Disney. I suppose it is mostly because he was able to find a way for my wife and I to feel like kids. It is also because he helps us believe there is a ***Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow, Shining at the End of Every Day***. Through his example, we keep moving forward! Our love for Disney is something we are quite passionate about.

# Recipes

> _**Anton Ego:** In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: **Anyone can cook**. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere._

At a young age, my mother ignited the spark that would become my passion to make great food. Today, I enjoy exploring that passion and feeding my family. I publish the recipes my family loves so you too can make great food. You will find a wide range of cuisine and courses that will please even the pickiest of eaters. I try to find and come up with some of the easiest and quickest things to make that aren't full of ingredients that will cause harm to my family.

# Technology

> _**Technologist:** a specialist in technology. AKA, a **"Master of None"**_

I wear many hats. The ones I'm most known for are those related to technology. Most notably as a software engineer. However, as a tinkerer, I also express my interest in hardware. Although I do not possess a higher education degree, the computer sciences are definitely a passion of mine. As a problem solver, I love to take full advantage of the technology around me to find solutions to everyday obstacles.
