Greg Marine  
Today I have a guest who has written the book. Don't say that at work. Mike Callahan or Michael Callahan, as it says on the cover, Mike, how are you today?

Michael Callaghan  
I am excellent. Greg, How about yourself?

Greg Marine  
I am doing quite well. Could you do me in the listeners a favor and tell us a little bit about yourself?

Michael Callaghan  
Oh, gosh, what is there to say?

You know, the big one, and that's that I am a technology cast member at the Walt Disney World Resort. Yes, technically, I work for Disney parks, experiences and products.

Greg Marine  
Lots more to say than a Walt Disney World, isn't it?

Michael Callaghan  
It is a lot easier just to tell people I work at Walt Disney World.

I am in my 26 27th year of professional software development. I started my professional development career about 10 years after I graduated high school, and I started learning to program in ninth grade. I've held a variety of jobs, almost all of them in tech since 1995. I've worked for little tiny startups. I've worked for big companies like Disney like Dell, Compaq, HP, Compaq, and HP was actually the same desk.

Greg Marine  
So that was during the time when HP purchased come back.

Michael Callaghan  
Yes, they called it a merger. But for those of us who lived through it, it was a takeover.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, I can imagine. So. without going into too much detail as far as IP with Disney, oh, what is it that you do today?

Michael Callaghan  
Well, let's see. Mostly I work on what we call cast facing applications. So not something you'd see in the park,

or

anything, you know, I don't work on ride, or show mechanics or anything like that. There's a lot of software that as you can imagine drives everything that we do here. I'm sure you've seen or heard the story that I've given about my work on Disney's magical express a few years back, it was my very first ionic project at Disney. Something you probably have seen. I did get a chance about a year or so go to work on my Disney experience. Oh and mobile app?

Greg Marine  
Yes. I have quite a bit of experience using my Disney experience.

Michael Callaghan  
My Disney experience, I think I can say this safely. Yeah, publicly is it is a native app. So there is an android version. There is a a an iPhone version. The project I worked on, is not native. So there's a portion of the application, I'm not going to tell you which one sure that if you click a button, you're actually using a an Angular, I believe it's an Angular five app. And I won't go into any more detail than that.

Greg Marine  
No problem. I appreciate any detail that you can offer. As you know, I frequent the parks down in Walt Disney World. My wife is there as we're recording this. And I will be there come December here in 2020. Very cool. So tell me what inspired you to write don't say that at work.

Michael Callaghan  
It was a tweet, actually, I made a kind of an offhanded tweet one day about, hey, the next time you want to say something about you should just do this. Instead ask the question, What if we do this? I think my example was, why don't you just do that in CSS? Instead of asking it that way? Imagine if you went to your coworkers and said, What if we try doing this and CSS?

Greg Marine  
Yeah, the tone sounds quite a bit different.

Michael Callaghan  
And somebody responded to that tweet, and said, if you ever make a course, I'd like to buy it. Okay. I thought well, I don't know that that would be a course. Maybe. But you know, at the time, we were in the middle of early portions of the of the pandemic. And I didn't have access to my recording studio at the time. My recording studio is my son's bedroom. Okay, and he was sent home. And so for about two months, I didn't have access to a recording studio. So instead, I just thought, I wonder if I could gather up enough stories like this. Turn it into a book.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, sort of as a side question here, something else you do besides writing a book such as this, you also do a mini video courses. And so so as you mentioned, you had a recording studio at your son's bedroom, that you basically do video courses on technology, a lot of it being Angular, and react for ionic. So, so in a way, the fact that you had to give up your recording studio kind of gave you incentive or motivation to switch mediums, so to speak.

Michael Callaghan  
No doubt. I suffer from restlessness, I can't

just

sit. That's a good way to put. So if I don't have some sort of a side gig going something to occupy my, my downtime, if you will,

Greg Marine  
I go a little stir crazy. I can imagine. So, especially with being in an environment where we're constantly, I'm also a software developer. So we're constantly being challenged day in day out, Hey, can we do this with this technology? Can we do that? It's hard to sit still, because that's kind of in our, our wheelhouse is to always constantly be moving. Absolutely. Now, the book, again, it's don't say that it work. However, it's kind of it's divided up into three parts. First part being, your thoughts can mislead you. The second being, your words can betray you. And of course, the third being your deeds can condemn you. So from from that, can you tell me a little bit more about each section of the book, and what each will teach us?

Michael Callaghan  
As you say it was originally simply don't say

that. And the first thing I did when I thought of the title is I went to Amazon and typed it in. And there's already a book called Don't say that. So I said, Okay, I'll look for how about Don't say that, at work. Don't say that at home. I'm gearing it more towards professionalism. I can't imagine that the techniques would fail at home, or at school. But my mindset was, these are stupid things that I've done at work at work throughout my career. So I just added don't do at work to the title don't say that at work. The reason it's divided the way it is, I was trying to think of a way to group the stories in some sort of a logical fashion I did just didn't want a bunch of random essays. And I thought that would be a really cool way to organize the book, things you should not be thinking about things you should not be saying and then things you should not do. And that they tend to lead one into the other. Your thoughts influence your words, and your thoughts and words combined can often influence your actions.

Greg Marine  
Oh, absolutely. I could not agree more.

Michael Callaghan  
If you get angry, you could say something that you regret. And if you're angry enough, you could say and then do something you might regret. One of the stories in the book is about a time there. I got a little angrier than I should have. I call it throwing a temper tantrum. I didn't get my way at work. And I believe my exact words were

I did what I thought was right.

I wrote the code, the way I thought would be best for the project. I will never do that again. I'm sorry. And I hung up the phone. problem was I hit initiated the call, which disconnected everyone immediately, including the senior architect for the company. As you can imagine, it didn't go over well,

Greg Marine  
I can imagine it didn't go over well at all.

Michael Callaghan  
I did not have a software development job for the next three years.

Greg Marine  
Oh, wow.

Michael Callaghan  
That was kind of my choice. But once I hung up the phone, there wasn't a whole lot of

recovery.

I could have apologized. In fact, I was given a chance to apologize, I was given the opportunity to stay on with the company in a probationary manner for at least or I believe it was no less than one year. But at the time, I was a little burned out. Didn't want to stay with a company that wasn't going to let us use not necessarily the latest and greatest software technologies. But in this case, it was one that they were insisting that we use a dying technology. So I use the opportunity as a really bad exit strategy.

Greg Marine  
Now you could say your hands were tied at the time and with that coupled with your burnout. You felt like it was time to go. Sure it was a temper tantrum. But like I certainly can understand. Even though it wasn't the best exit strategy, it was probably a strategy that probably worked out best for you.

Michael Callaghan  
One of the lessons learned from that temper tantrum is there was probably a better way I could have handled it.

I could have

written the code that they wanted, and written it the way I wanted to, to be able to showcase the different difference. Sure. But instead, I knew best and I just ran forward with it. And that got me in a lot of trouble. Okay, I often wonder this was at Hewlett Packard. And I often wonder what my career would have looked like if I had stayed at HP. I heard many years later that a lot of the developers stuck around were moved by the company to Austin. I was in Southern New Hampshire at the time. And a lot of them that stuck around ended up getting moved by the company to Texas. I'm in Florida now. Texas is different. But I do like Texas, and I like the Austin area. So I think I could have made something out of my career there. But

Greg Marine  
you can't tell right? There's no way to know what's right. And who knows if you would end up but at the Walt Disney World Resort, you know, 10 years ago. Right. So now that's a story from your section. your deeds can condemn you. I recall, one of the best chapters in your thoughts can mislead you. The first section of the book was don't succumb to prejudice. Now, as I understand it, when you say prejudice here, you're not really talking about bigotry.

Michael Callaghan  
Correct. I'm using prejudice in the more pure sense of the word as in prejudge. So you and I have a pretty good relationship. We've, I think we've become friends over the past six months.

If I were to suddenly hear a story about you that

seemed

off my knee, my initial reaction wouldn't be Wow, I Greg's a horrible person, I can't can't, you know, can't believe that. It would be my first reaction, because because I've gotten to know you and have a positive affinity towards you

is

something must be wrong with that statement. Something must be wrong with the allegation. Or maybe there was a misunderstanding. On the other hand, if it were somebody that I didn't necessarily get along with, and I heard something bad about them, some sort of a gossip. Probably my first instinct, would it be good would be something like, yeah, I always knew that guy was something wrong with him.

Greg Marine  
That makes sense. Well, it absolutely does. And I can totally relate. I've had those very similar circumstances happen in my career as well. So I can certainly relate and reading the stories that you present in that section of the book really brought up into my mind those stories and thought, okay, now, this is how I can do it differently next time. And so I really appreciate the advice that you provide in this book. Don't say that at work here. And in that section, so. And also, in the second section, your your words can betray you. One of the and it's even a popular topic on Twitter today, as several tweets that you've made, even this very week have been about TL A's. What's the TLA?

Michael Callaghan  
I have hated TL A's. All my career. There's I have a blind spot around them. I don't see them. So TLA is a three letter acronym. In these days, it can mean a four or five or six letter acronym. Sure. One acronym You and I are both very familiar with is Epcot. It originally was experimental prototype community of tomorrow. I believe ESPN is another acronym. And honestly, I have no idea what it stands for. Do you? I do not. I'm sure we could look it up.

I think it's something sports programming network.

Greg Marine  
I don't know. I'm sure it's related to that. But honestly, like you said, I don't know because it's become what it's called, like everybody knows it as ESPN. That isn't always the case with the TLA.

Michael Callaghan  
Not Not at all.

One of the stories from the book is that I was

at one point here at Disney I was asked to participate in a JADR

Greg Marine  
What's that?

Michael Callaghan  
JADR

And if you go and look it up at the acronym dictionary, nothing is relevant. But the one I really liked was the I believe it's the Japanese association of dental researchers, researchers

Greg Marine  
on I can't imagine that's what they were talking about.

Michael Callaghan  
That is not what they wanted me to do to attend. No.

It was a joint architectural design review.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, that's that doesn't that would not have come to me naturally.

Michael Callaghan  
And once they told me what it was, I still didn't want to attend.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, you know, and in my long career, I've been doing this for 24, almost 25 years myself, and I've come across a lot of three letter acronyms, or now, as you said, they've gone into multiple letters beyond three. But there's a lot of that going around. And we always have to ask, but based on some of the advice from your book, in that chapter, it's probably a good idea to kind of spell out what it is, and then put that in parentheses or something like that. So that the reader who's may not be used to it, if they're on an, if new to your team, can know what those are, or even have a running dictionary, in a git repository that says, here's what these acronyms are on this team or on this project.

Michael Callaghan  
If you ever want to see a really good example of this, Jimmy Kimmel, whom, as you know, has a show on ABC, and ABC is owned by Disney. He read a letter on the air that he got from Disney corporate, that was nothing but it was just filled with acronyms. And in reading it. his point was, this is indecipherable. Because I don't know what that means, you know, and if you hear people talk about HR, human resources, you don't tend to think too much about it. Right. But this gets down into the nitty gritty. I don't know if you're aware, do you ever use a software package called SAP?

Greg Marine  
I have in the past, yes.

Michael Callaghan  
As far as I know. That's just what it's called. Now. I don't even know what it stands for. Yeah. And if I can give you one amusing one that happened to us a couple of years ago, you and I are both in software. So I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you know what ci CD means?

Greg Marine  
Yes, I do. It's a continuous integration, continuous development or delivery.

Michael Callaghan  
Correct.

Early on on a project, one of the business owners of the project, asked what ci CD stood for. And one of the guys in the room said constant interruption constant delay.

I guess nobody laughed.

Greg Marine  
Okay.

Michael Callaghan  
So our business rep thought he was serious, and mentioned it in a meeting days later with senior leadership.

Greg Marine  
Oh, my.

Michael Callaghan  
So they thought that he was insulting them. So it's amusing to look back on and chuckle about it now. But it didn't go over. Well, at the time.

Greg Marine  
We're sure on I remember. Story, someone told me once where they had used the acronym id 10. t. If you write it down, it says spells idiot. But they sold somebody they were working at a like an Office Depot. And the customer was explaining the problem and, and he said, sounds like an ID 10 tier. And of course, the person knew what they were saying. And they were upset and walked right up to their manager explained the problem. This person just called me an idiot. And thought I was an idiot, since I thought I didn't know what Id 10 T was

Michael Callaghan  
nice.

I learned one back at HP called PEBKAC.

Greg Marine  
Oh, yes, problems exist

Michael Callaghan  
between keyboard and chair.

Greg Marine  
That's right. That's my number one problem. On another one on that section of your words can betray you, you talk about don't talk so fast. And I deliberately said that slightly slower. Because in that particular example, and that particular story, you talk about how, you know, if you talk too fast, it's hard for your listeners to listen and understand you. Tell me a little bit about where that came from.

Michael Callaghan  
The history of that one actually goes a lot farther than what I mentioned in the book. So I'm going to give you a little bit more here. Excellent. When I was in high school in college, I spoke so quickly, the people didn't really understand what I'm talking about. My natural inclination was to stop quickly. And I can still do it if now if I really want to. Sure.

But I've trained myself over the years not to do it as much as I used to.

And it got so bad I was in sales. I used to work for a store in Laurel, Maryland. And it was hurting me professionally. Because you know, the quick talking salesman. I had that image, okay, at the time, I was probably only 20 or 21 years old. So people coming into the store seeing this quote unquote, kid trying to fast talk them into selling, you know, into buying a $2,000 television. It was tough. And I remained in sales for a number of years after that before I broke into software development, so I had to school myself until talking slowly really hit home though. I was in a meeting at church. And it was with the older teenage boys or young men's group. And so I was in a room with a bunch of, say, 16 and 17 year olds. And it's difficult to get them to concentrate, as it is, as you know, teenagers can be.

Greg Marine  
Absolutely I remember those years, not only as a teenager, but my two kids as teenagers now.

Michael Callaghan  
So this will probably sound familiar. I don't remember exactly what the scripture passage was. But I asked one of the young men to read it, and he blew through it. And looking around the room, no one's paying attention. And this is not a big room, there was maybe five or six boys in there and a few adults. And I said, hang on a second, would you read that again? as slowly as you possibly can, without feeling awkward? And I said, I want the rest of you just to close your eyes and listen. And surprisingly enough, they all did. So he read the passage again. And it was almost, you could almost feel the difference in the room. It didn't sound forced. It didn't sound awkward. It didn't sound monotone. It just felt that he was speaking with feeling. I say, and I asked him,

did you feel the difference? And everybody?

They said, Yes.

So let's try a little experiment. Let's do it again, let's each one of us do that. And I turned to them. Because a lot of people think that if I talk too slowly, that I will take too much time. And I believe it was about 20 to 25 seconds, when he read it naturally, just I'm going to do it and see what it sounds like. And then when he did it as slowly as possible, it jumped to 35 seconds. Okay, as a percentage, that's not insignificant. But in actual time, we added five to 10 seconds to what he was saying. But the difference in how it came across was night and day. And so in the book, I'm sure you saw that my recommendation wasn't to read a religious passions, but I read the preamble to the US Constitution. And I put the three readings, I read it my normal speed as fast as I could do it without tripping over myself. And then as slowly as I could, and I put those on YouTube.

And I believe it makes a difference.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, I believe, too. And I totally agree with you on that. And I'll put the links to that in the show notes so that the listeners can get a little taste of that, as well as the link to the book. But yeah, what happened next after that with those, those kids?

Michael Callaghan  
I asked them to start doing it

all the time. Okay,

maybe for the next week or two. I said when you have to go and talk to someone particular, particularly here at church. Slow down. Don't be in such hurry. So if someone asks you a question, look them in the eye, answer as clearly and as slowly as you can. And a few weeks went by, and somebody commented to me, I don't know what you've done with those boys, but they are they seem to be more respectful. They seem to be just better behaved. I, I can't put my finger on what what you've done, though, but it's different.

Greg Marine  
Well, it was quite interesting. I

Michael Callaghan  
didn't have the heart to tell him I just told them to slow down.

Greg Marine  
Now, that's excellent. And as a matter of fact, I did something similar. After reading that portion of the book, I started to do the same with my interactions with my family. And because this is all taking place during COVID-19, we don't aren't going on a lot of places right now. So I've decided to practice this on my family. And believe it or not, I was I was surprised and shocked at how well this worked, that they stopped asking me to repeat myself. And that that's a huge time saver because that five or six seconds of time that I extended what I was saying reduced how many times I had to say it to one, therefore saving me time and saving them confusion. I can see that

Michael Callaghan  
definitely see that. Another interesting thing that happens when you speak more slowly and I'm not sure why this is you tend to not speak as loudly. I know there is a saying if You will.

I'll tell you what it is. And I'll tell you where I got it.

The the quote, is he strange to hear a whisper who refuses to hear a shout. If you've ever been in a room with someone who doesn't speak loudly, when that person speaks, everyone kind of shuts up so they can hear him. Hear him or her? Indeed, yeah. Are you? Are you a fantasy novel fan?

Greg Marine  
No, I'm not in particularly.

Michael Callaghan  
Okay. That is from I don't remember which novel in the series, but it's from the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series.

Greg Marine  
Okay, I'm familiar with that. have not read them. Okay, now the book is don't say that at work. Now, I understand that you have other books. But besides this book, and the other ones, the reason I haven't mentioned them by name is because you've actually started those books, as video courses. Tell me a little bit more about the other projects that you have, such as the video courses.

Michael Callaghan  
As I think you are aware, I have four video courses available at Pluralsight. And they are all ionic based in one way or another. The very first one, I think, has been retired. So technically, there are only three now I have one on the use of the ionic COI. And I believe it was based on version three. So I don't know how much much value you're gonna get out of it these days. The second one was ionic and electron. So using the Ionic framework with Angular to make desktop applications that you can put, you know, install onto Windows, Linux and Mac. And that one's done pretty well. The third one was making progressive web apps with ionic. And that one, they told me they're going to retire very soon now because they have a progressive web app track learning track at Pluralsight. And they didn't think that the ionic specific version fit in with their track. And when I told them that ionic was really just the, the UI portion that it was really pw a with Angular.

They got a little annoyed.

Because they, they thought that I had kind of snuck something in. But that wasn't the intention. It was pw with ionic. As I went through it, and completed the course, I realized there's very little ionic here. This is this can apply to anything. So to me, it was a happy coincidence.

So probably about

the beginning of 2020. Someone had suggested or someone had asked if I had a react version of any of my ionic courses. And I said, You know, I don't because I've never used react.

I've always just been Angular since AngularJS. One, two, I think. So it never really occurred to me to look into react. But then one day, I needed to upgrade one of my one of my minor little payment ionic apps. From ionic three to five, I thought, Well, you know what, this isn't a real complicated app. Let's go ahead and see what it would be like if I use react instead. And that led to a blog post that was a Confessions of a reluctant ionic, React user. And once I had done that, I realized that, you know, there's something to this, there's, there's probably an untapped market out here. Because everything that I've seen for ionic to that point, was Angular based. And ionic react wasn't I don't think officially released yet. It was close. And so I talked to a couple of the guys that ionic and they were, as you can imagine, they were excited about the idea. And so I went back to Pluralsight. And I pitched it, and was turned down pretty quickly.

Greg Marine  
Oh, wow. Interesting.

Michael Callaghan  
They said that's not part of our strategy right now. So I don't know if it was the ionic portion, or the React portion or combination of both, you know, maybe they thought it was not widespread enough. But for whatever reason, they turned it down. And so I decided, I'll just give it a try. There, you know, I don't necessarily have to do this through them. I could, I can create content and put it anywhere. I can put it on YouTube. I could put it on gumroad. I could put it on Udemy. Let's, let's see. And I found a few sites that are willing to try it out on and so I started throwing lessons together. And I think at the time, because I knew I wouldn't have the team that I had a Pluralsight the quality assurance team, but I decided to enlist some folks from social media. And I think that's where you and I met Put up the call and said, Hey, if anyone's interested and willing to help QA course, I'll give you the course content for free. Yeah. And

Greg Marine  
I saw that, and I instantly hooked onto it. for a few reasons. One, I had been following you for about a year prior to that I saw your love for Disney. And then also, this is a react course. And I was very interested in how ionic was was merging or using implementing their their ionic react, as opposed to their Angular, which I had been using for years. So yeah, I was very interested in that. And, and you're right, that's how you and I started our friendship.

Michael Callaghan  
And I believe it was even you who suggested one day one I do and I and angular version at the same time in parallel, because they're going to share a lot of the same content.

Greg Marine  
Exactly. And I think the reason I suggested that was because that would give people an opportunity, not only to subsurface subscribe to both lessons, but be able to see the comparisons between Angular and react using the same UI framework and ionic.

Michael Callaghan  
Exactly. And so I did that, I actually created a Google Doc that had three columns in it. The content from I took the content from the React all the text from the React version that I hadn't finished, I think I'd finished the first complete course write chapter one, as I called it, yes. And then I copied and pasted into the second column, and just went through and started making changes, well, this code will be different, This command will be different. And in the end, it turned out that they were very 70%, the same, the concepts are the same. The component names are the same, the attributes of the components are the same. The COI commands are a little bit different. Angular gives you that really robust ccli for doing scaffolding and project generation. React doesn't have any of that, or doesn't have as much of them. Angular seems to be a lot more heavily focused on pure separation of concerns.

So my components look different.

Angular also, if I'm, if I recall correctly, it's been a few months, is much more geared towards making sure that you have unit tests for all of your component code. And I don't believe the React version has that. Yeah, I believe you're correct. Honestly, the unit testing was kind of immaterial to here's how you use the components.

Greg Marine  
Exactly.

Michael Callaghan  
So I didn't really touch on that. One of the things that I found pretty amazing. Once I got past, setting up the application and doing a little navigation and putting some data on the screen was, I jumped ahead to Okay, how do we get this on the app store? That book is identical. There's no differences between the React version and the angular version. So I changed my strategy a little on it's now a second book. So the first book is part one, creating a UI and getting it getting data on the screen. The second book is, okay, I don't care how you got here, but you've got the application. It's an ionic app, don't care what your technology is. Here's how you get it onto Apple's App Store.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, you make use of capacitor JS for that, is that correct?

Michael Callaghan  
I do. I got into capacitor very early on with my electron course. And, in fact, I had to submit a pull request to capacitor to work with electron version four. That was the first official, Mike Callahan is an open source contributor.

Greg Marine  
Very nice. And that contribution helps make electron be just as equally supported. I know it's still kind of in a beta phase for ionic. But the nice thing is, is that capacitor allows you to glue all of these skills that you have in web development, to be able to work both in mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, and then also on the desktop of electron. Right. Right.

Michael Callaghan  
Once I'm finished with don't say that my plan is to go back and do the next version in that series. So the next volume in that series, which will be okay, you've got the app. Now, let's put it on Google Play. I knew that there would be some similarities there. But a lot of the nitty gritty how to get it onto the App Store is different than how to get it onto the Play Store. The capacitor portion is the same. But I wanted to tackle them separately. So those books are a lot shorter, and they're a lot less expensive.

Greg Marine  
Now I know that those became books, originally video courses became books because of with the COVID-19 affecting everybody and everybody going back home. You lost your recording studio that kind of plunged you under book writing, which then led to don't say that at work. But that's just amazing. As a way of coping with the situation of the year, that is affect billions of lives. And so that kind of brings me to today. What's next for Mike?

Michael Callaghan  
What is next for Mike?

One of the more surprising things for me, was the reception of the various titles. I've always considered myself a techie. I'm a geek, I'm a nerd, whatever. Whatever derogatory term you want to use for computer programmer. That's me, I, I fit a lot of the stereotypes. And I've always embraced that I've never tried to run from it. So yes, Mike Callahan creates techie

books, and techie courses.

And so I have, I think, 33 ionic courses available. There are 123 of the three books available. That goes along with those courses. And then there's another book that I wrote, kind of as an experiment. Before I started with it with the ionic stuff. I took the presentation, I was going to give a dev intersection this year. It was supposed to be about an hour long talk on Angular progressive web apps. And I turned it into a book

and ended up being 80 pages.

You have an Angular app. Let's deploy it in such a way that mobile users can install it as a progressive web app. How do you do that? Okay, so for books, a few courses? Finally, don't say that. On day one, don't say that outsold everything else combined. Oh, wow. That's incredible. So the question I have to ask myself is, do I want to continue writing textbooks and tech courses? There's obviously a larger audience for business communication failures.

And

I hate to say it, I have more material, because I've made a lot more mistakes than I've written ionic apps. So when you combine those two facts, I really think that my next thing after I really finished Don't say that. And there's there's a couple of things I still want to do here. But after don't say that is completely done and released, including the print version, the ebook and the audio book that I'm working on. The two titles that are rattling around in my head right now are my working titles, our scout law of leadership, and that is applying the 12 principles of the boy scout law, to leadership. Because regardless of what you may think about the Boy Scouts, or about what you think they do, the entire program is about leadership, building leaders. And I learned a lot about being a leader being a professional, from what I learned in scouting. And I was never a scout as a child, I was only a scout, a Scouter as an adult.

Greg Marine  
Okay, and that sounds like it's gonna be a very interesting read.

Michael Callaghan  
I hope so. And the other one, my working title is reluctant recitation,

how to give a talk when you don't want to. Okay.

And that one also grew out of

coaching the youth at our church for public speaking. Okay. Many of them follow into the same patterns. Hi, my name is Mike. I was asked to talk to you today on

bird watching.

bird watching is cool.

The Webster's Dictionary defines bird watching.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, now I have to say but at this point, I've already tuned you out. So it doesn't sound like you're interested in watching

Unknown Speaker  
my site.

Michael Callaghan  
I flew myself out so

and so that book will be all about how to prepare for a talk, how to deliver it, what not to say what not to do. When I used to give presentations, in sales, I had two really bad habits that I had to break. One is that I would take a sip of my water, but my water always had ice in it. Okay, we get Eisen in my drink and I would chew on it while trying to give a presentation.

Greg Marine  
I was thinking you were gonna say the clean cleaning in the glass on the microphone, but it's no worse.

Michael Callaghan  
I Rick crunch crunch crunch while I'm trying to talk. Oh, and I didn't realize I

Greg Marine  
was doing it. That'd be very distracting.

Michael Callaghan  
The other thing I would do is if I had anything at all in my pocket keys change.

I would rattle the

And I did it without

any awareness whatsoever,

Greg Marine  
sort of a nervous tic. Very similar.

Michael Callaghan  
Yes. So there will be that sort of thing in there. Okay, there will be, what your should your talk consist of, and a lot of this, this isn't going to just be for youth. This could be for anybody who's got to give an oral presentation, or even a PowerPoint presentation. The PowerPoint presentation should be an oral presentation.

Greg Marine  
Absolutely. The

Michael Callaghan  
slides aren't for them. They're for you.

Yes. And if you're reading a slide full of paragraphs,

you're doing it wrong.

Greg Marine  
Oh, absolutely. I could not agree more. So

Michael Callaghan  
I'm still looking for a better title than reluctant recitation.

So if you have any ideas,

Greg Marine  
if I have any ideas, I will let you know. I know where to find you.

Michael Callaghan  
Sorry, speaker.

Greg Marine  
Well, the the current book that we discussed most of the time, and this talk was don't say that it worked. It's currently available on gumroad, soon to be available on Amazon. But a time you're listening to this, it probably will be on Amazon. And, Mike, I want to thank you so much, not only for being with me today on this talk, but also for inviting me to be a part of this project. I was able to write the foreword, and also write the chapter Don't interrupt. I'm the author of that chapter. So I want to thank you for that as well. And again, thank you for being on talking tech.

Michael Callaghan  
appreciate you having me sir.
