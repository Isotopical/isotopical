Greg Marine  
I have a special guest today, who's a high school teacher, and Ivy Tech professor, and a media director at church. He is not only a professional in his community, he's also my brother, Andrew Marine. Welcome, Andrew. How are you today?

Andrew Marine  
Doing wonderful. Thank you, Greg, for having me.

Greg Marine  
Can you do us a favor, for all of my listeners, tell us a little bit about yourself.

Andrew Marine  
I'm a man who's passionate about telling stories, and using technology to tell those stories. And so I think that's kind of what brings us into this conversation. And so when you look at my background, I'm a compositionist, I just finished up my second master's degree and that was in English through IU east. And I also have a journalism Master's through Ball State University, and an English education bachelor's degree through ISU (Indiana State University). And so all of those backgrounds that I have there, point to storytelling, and I have embraced the technology to help me tell those stories in the various modes that exists out there, whether that be video, audio, in the the regular text, print format. So when you combine them together, you've got multi-modes, and I just absolutely love telling stories.

Greg Marine  
Excellent, excellent. And that is something from our childhood that I do recall. I've known you for four decades. That's that's experience I have with you. So again, I thank you for being on the show today and being a part of this brand new podcast. And so as a storyteller, tell me a little bit about your time at ISU. I recall there being not really the dawn of the internet. But as far as your experience with the Internet, and technology. It really began at ISU with a computer that you check the email on in the lobby of your dorm room.

Andrew Marine  
Well, yeah, it's actually in the lobby of our dormitory. And so down on the first level, that there was one station with the CRT computer, and it was nothing but that green Look, there's no graphic user interface or anything like that. So it was very bland, just all text based. And that was how I checked my email for classes and for any other communication with my peers.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, imagine that the text only no images. No, what we call emojis today. Oh, no, the emojis were simple text. It was colon dash smiley face for, for for a smiley face.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah. And to give you context, I mean, the laptop computer wasn't around yet. There was one central computer lab for for students to go to if they wanted to type out a paper there. But I had a daisy wheel printing brother.

What you know, printer, basically a

Greg Marine  
type of

Andrew Marine  
word processor with that green, it was a very small, like you only had like three or four lines on it of text at a time. And then when you're ready to hit print, I went into the into my dormitory lobby on my floor, closed all the doors around and then it would start Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting Ting running out the whole paper.

Greg Marine  
Well, you're definitely taking me back. I remember that. And it was like a floppy disk. I think that store. Yes. Yeah. You didn't have a hard drive a hard drive? Well, I'll tell you what. Those were the days and I remember I quite remember it well. And from there. You graduated Of course after four years of college there and then you went into your early years of teaching. And at that point. Were you were you were there a lot of computers in the classroom, or were you still working with pen and paper

Andrew Marine  
is pretty much pen and paper as an English teacher. My students were submitting papers via regular paper, we weren't, we didn't have the computers, you know, readily relatively available, especially at the junior high that I first started teaching at. We just didn't have that fact, as far as technology was concerned, I had a computer

Unknown Speaker  
that I could,

Andrew Marine  
you know, use a little bit but as far as technology in the classroom was concerned, we only had an Elmo projector. And so I was using dry erase markers to take notes and for students to be able to see projected up on the screen. That was it. That's all we had.

Greg Marine  
Interesting Elmo projector light bulb projected onto a screen that you pulled down in front of the billboard or the Blackboard.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah, so that I mean, that's all we had. I mean, the chalk dust was still around when I had the chalk dust on my arm, you know? For for some of my classrooms. So yeah, I come from that old school time. It's been interesting, transitioning from that to where we're at today.

Greg Marine  
Okay, speaking of that transition, one of the things that you did, during your transition, as you started working with broadcast journalism, or television news, journalism, within the classroom, tell me a little bit about that transition.

Andrew Marine  
Wow, that transition. that opportunity came to me a little bit about my background was, I was scared to death of computers, as far as opening them up. And, and, and seeing what's underneath the hood. I just was tech scared. So for those of you that are watching this, and you're thinking, well, this guy just just loves tech. I mean, he's been around tech all his life. And he, he loves this stuff. Well, yes, I do. But I started out as that person who didn't want to touch it, I might break it kind of person. And so I can really relate to, to both students and to my peers, who are scared to death of it, because I had to overcome that in order to become a tech savvy storyteller. And so this is part of my story. The first lab that I was in for broadcast, it had a single computer that was collecting dust on a shelf. The the method of that was being used in there at the time was not was linear editing, which was taking two VC VHS tape players. And you play one, and then you go to play the second one, and it records to the master

Greg Marine  
third one. So this wasn't even DVD or digital. This was Oh, no VHS or my VHS, VHS. Wow. And

Andrew Marine  
it's splice. There's a I actually had a console that could jog shuttle toggle, and would splice at the at the exact moment that you wanted to onto the master.

Greg Marine  
But all analog basically,

Andrew Marine  
it was analog. And it was very manual. It was very slow. It was dinosaur in it. Oh, it just it was difficult. But the the one computer that we did have shelved. It was called Casa Blanca. It was large and black it to make it look like a VHS console. So I thought there's irony in that. But the principle was pretty bent that it was sitting on the shelf from my predecessor. So I, I brought it out. And I started using it. And, and so we had this linear with a nonlinear. And so I showed the principal, here's what we're doing with it now.

And then I used

one of my computers at home

to do some more editing. And I showed him. Okay, so this is what we're doing currently with Casa Blanca. Here's what we can do with Casa Blanca, and another computer. He got us another computer. And I started using Casa Blanca in that other computer, and I showed him what we were doing with it there. And then another one of my computers, and I said, Imagine what we could do if we had a whole lab. Oh, wow. And we got 16 computers.

Greg Marine  
Excellent. Okay,

Andrew Marine  
and so and that that opened the doors for us to really launch into the the nonlinear digital age of broadcasting.

Greg Marine  
That that's that is incredible. And I'm curious though, now that you have 16 computers for your broadcast class, how does that affect the rest of your education as you're teaching Your English course and your literature courses. How does that advancement in broadcast journalism affect those classes?

Andrew Marine  
Well, I mean, that was a little microcosm of its own within there, but about that time, you're starting to get computer labs in the building to the computer labs in the building as those started popping up. Then my English classes, my students, I would, I said, No more paper, you can use paper to do your early drafting, that final draft is coming on printed paper, from the printers in the lab. And so we would, we would have certain drafting days in the classroom, and then we'd have certain drafting days in the computer lab. And so I had to schedule my timeout in the labs in order to make that possible. And so I had to become a lot more organized as far as scheduling locations and such for students to be able to use those tools to write their papers.

Greg Marine  
And then as that was taking place, as a teacher, what kind of tools were you starting to, to adopt? Whether it be from your personal finances or from the school finances? What kind of tools were you starting to adopt, to make it easier for you to grade those papers as they were doing them in the lab?

Andrew Marine  
Well, at the time, there was still a lot of paper cuts.

Unknown Speaker  
I was sure I still,

Andrew Marine  
you know, I at this point now where I'm at, it's a paperless environment. But at the time with the labs, it was still a lot of paper involved. And that was going to be the case until the students started having their own laptops. Okay, when, when the netbooks came along. This is before Chromebooks. When netbooks came along, that became the potential game changer. And I'll say potential because as I started having some sections of my courses having those netbooks they started with, I believe, the seniors, and then they went to the juniors, and it started working its way down. As I was having some of my classes with those netbooks. I saw the great potential there of, Hey, we don't have to have a lab anymore. I can do it right here. I don't have to schedule it out the different rooms, we can do it right here. And then they could submit it directly to me without any paper. And I saw the potential in that. But the problem was those netbooks were terrible.

Greg Marine  
Oh, okay.

Andrew Marine  
They were awful. They would fall apart. And and they they weren't connecting Well, what you'd call our our Wi Fi routing networks were very weak at the time, it was cutting edge. And so I saw the vision of where it was going. I wanted to get it there. But there's a lot of frustration with the students because it's not working with me. I'm a troubleshooter, so I'm going to keep working it, working it and working until it works. And so the students with me, they would get a little more comfortable with it. But those netbooks were terrible. But when the Chromebook came, then we were in business, okay, how to with the Wi Fi, connectivity in the building had grown enough. And the Chromebooks were stable enough to get that job done. And it did become a paperless environment at that point.

Greg Marine  
So for you and your school district up, in particular, your school building, you became one of the pioneers that kind of pushed the technology to its bleeding edge. Yes, still, the technology the hardware was able to catch up.

Andrew Marine  
Exactly. And I was pretty much the only one in the English department doing that, pushing it to that level. Now, I do have a couple of colleagues that now pretty much run paperless as well. They will grade on iPads and such. And that's what I started with. Actually, when I wanted to be totally paperless. Even for my feedback to the students. I would use an iPad. There was a there is a program still out there. It's called I annotate. And you can use your Apple Pencil on it and mark it up. It also has stamps on it. So if there's the normal things that have got to put down like awkward phrase, or, or insert comma, whatever, I could just add it like that. But I discovered doing stamps was kind of slow for me. Especially when I end up investing In another technology more recently, I'd say it's been about three years now that I've been using this onyx, Chinese company makes books b o x. And it is an E ink tablet that you can put, it's the size of a piece of paper, basically, it's a 13.3 inch screen. And it's an E ink tablet, it saves my eyes. That's why I got it. Because it's not backlit, it uses the the ambient light around and, and then I'm able to write on using a Wacom pin. Okay, and so I'm able to, to do it, it's black and white for me, but I make the pin color blue for the students, when I export that PDF, and send it back as a comment through our anyway, it's it's the type of interface that you can use for having online classes and such.

Greg Marine  
And that them on their Chromebooks

Andrew Marine  
learning management system. That's it

Greg Marine  
learning management system, they see what you've annotated on on your tablet. Yep. Your eating tablet goes to their Chromebook they see it in color, regardless of what you see on your Yes, ink. Okay,

Andrew Marine  
yeah. And I use blue ink. Because red ink is just blood on a paper. So I use blue blood on a paper. There you go. So and I mean, that's just totally revolutionized how I teach English.

Greg Marine  
Excellent. Now as go ahead and bring that back onto the screen here, you've got this E ink tablet, it's a paper size 13 point. What was it again, 3.3 13.3 inch screen. It's basically a piece of paper that's electronic. So you can have all of their papers in your hand, without a stack of physical papers on your desk. Exactly. And you can take it home with you from from the from your classroom, to your home, you don't have to deal with all that paper, paper cuts are a thing of the past. Yep. And you do all of it on this on this device, all electronic. And eventually, of course, it gets sent over the Internet to their their students machines. They can make any updates in the back to you. Yeah, and there's no paper involved. Speaking of that, one of the things that has happened to our students this year, and this is 2020. We're recording this in October of 2020. And needless to say, it's been a rough year COVID-19 has spread across the entire planet. It began in late 19 or 2019. And which is why it was labeled COVID-19. And it has wreaked havoc all over the planet. And one of the things most affected by it not only is the closing of businesses and our economy, but its schools. And so that is affected you and your students back in, I would say march of 2020. A lot of the schools closed and therefore

became virtual overnight. Were you prepared for that?

Andrew Marine  
I would say absolutely. I was ready to go on day one. When we closed. Now there were some serious challenges, especially for my broadcast class. Here we are. We're, you know it, you know, fast forward several years, we have another computer lab that's got 25 max in it. And and all of our tools that we have at our disposal, were automatically one day just shut off.

Well, what do we do now?

I mean, how do we function?

And so I want to I want to talk about my broadcast experience first and then I'll get back to my English class experience for broadcast. I'll be honest, those first two weeks that we were out, I won't say I was flailing as a as an advisor. But one thing that I discovered real quickly is just studying other videos, you know, how do other broadcasts handle basketball games? What are the different camera shots? What are the commentators saying doing? What are the graphics that are going into it? Sure, studying other film as it might apply to our own because I mean, literally, we had just finished covering all five sectional basketball games from our arena neutral sight, our team was only in one of those five games, yet our broadcast team covered the entire event, multi cams, with commentators everything, we had a blast, the place was rocking. And then all of a sudden, next week were shut down. And and so what does a broadcast team do? And so at the end of that two weeks, we went on a spring break, and I had to do some serious soul searching. How are we going to do this? I have to create some momentum for our team, to gel to be together. Because we needed this. We needed to be with each other, because we were isolated from each other. How do we get together and make this work? And so I created a new rhythm with them. We met every Friday, to discuss the next week. So it was a full staff meeting, we got on a zoom conference, the whole team, and we would brainstorm to create a weekly show.

Greg Marine  
That would air every Friday. Okay, we would

Andrew Marine  
meet on Friday after all of the pieces have been put together and planned for the next week. And so we would plan together and then we would break. And one week later, we had a show.

Greg Marine  
That is excellent. See that? That tells me that you were your team were prepared as prepared as the national news was you were doing the same thing that the American news or even international news, we're doing daily, you were already prepared to do that at the high school level.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah, it was Google Drive. That was that was the technological piece that was able to get us to, to gel it all together. So that we each worked individually, and then pieced it together using a Google Drive shared Google Drive folder, where our executive producer, he would put them all together and would host a show from his house. Kind of like what we're doing right now. And, and it was amazing. It really, it was amazing to see how the students work together. I mean, you know, cooking with Kelsey, that segment was so cool. Because she would use these homemade remedy recipe things and share it with the general population. Okay, it was it was a fun thing. As part of our, our, our broadcast every, every week.

Greg Marine  
Yeah. And I want to make sure to make a focus on the fact that these are students, these are those in their prime of high school, who were thrown into something that you and I did not experience in our high school years, coming up with new ideas to make do with the current situation they were in, they were stuck at home, they were putting together a broadcast that included new material, but they hadn't even considered it before. And all of a sudden, they're doing this cooking with Kelsey or whatever else they were doing. As students, these are teenagers. Yes. And yes. And that that's, that says a lot about them as people, I would say it also says a lot about them as their their parents and their teacher. I mean, so this is exciting. I mean, this is an exciting topic that in the middle of a global pandemic that's affected billions and billions of people. You've got a set of students who are making the most of it.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah, I mean, we even had a tornado that hit our town in the midst of all of this COVID-19. And I had a student that loves photography, that's in the broadcast program, he went out and took some, some pictures next day, you know, it had the, you know, the caution tape in the shot and everything. And we ended up using it as part of, of that week's show, you know, it just, they were just amazing in that circumstance, that they were able to take whatever resources they had at home, but it was their cell phone or a camera of some sort. Their Chromebook or if they had a desktop computer, whatever they had at home, they used it and linked it together through the Google Drive. And it was it was something special. It really was. And as part of our broadcast program, we also do a senior slideshow for our graduation ceremony. And behind the scenes, we were preparing for two graduation ceremonies, one that would have been all virtual, which hurt Jones was going to be running that but we still had to have our senior slideshow to give to them and then doing it live and it turns out That in late July, we were able to have our live commencement when it comes to the my English Composition courses, and at the time, I was also teaching English 11. teaching those kids in this environment, I was already prepared, already had my LMS had Canvas, I'd already been using Canvas long before the pandemic hit, I'd already been using what are called modules where I, I put the lesson for the day together. Those are things that the rest of the staff had to learn to do. As far as doing daily lessons, I wasn't quite doing that. But as far as my units were concerned, all of my units with their requirements in the assignments, I was already doing that. And so my students were already familiar with it. And so that there was a familiarity there. What was different was, I had to create a whole bunch of videos. And so I became the king of five minute videos, and introducing things doing tutorials. And using zoom quite a bit. Using loom loom was my main tutorial using a software I was using. And I'm still using it Actually, it was important, those loom items I was using for the graduation slideshow pieces, because I had four students working on making the slides and doing photo editing and so forth. And so they were using photo editing with with Photoshop through a virtual machine, they had a VM client that they had to log into, to get to Photoshop, edit it in there, and then share it to the Google Drive with me. And then I would review it. And then anytime I had a to do a critique, and send it back to them to continue working on it, I would record a loom video for them and send them the link. And so they watched the loom video where I shared my screen showing them what they did well, what I still see as being an issue for them to to correct that. And then they send it back to me. So that's how my dialogue and communication went with especially advanced kids on that. But I would also do that. For other things, such as the, their their papers, I decided this was something I saw a couple of my professors doing while I was working on my English master's degree that they would have the written comments, but they would also do audio comments. And so I started doing audio comments back to my students. And I'm still doing that today.

Greg Marine  
Okay, so you started doing audio comments, because of the COVID-19 situation.

Andrew Marine  
I was starting to dabble with it just before in seeing how it was playing out seeing what the kids thought I was doing that about a semester before. We actually you know, the, the, the spring of 2019 is when I started doing that. I continued it into the fall 2019. And then by the time we hit pandemic time, man, that was definitely the way to go.

Greg Marine  
Okay, so what I'm basically understanding here at this point, is that you and your students are ready for COVID-19 didn't sound like all of your colleagues were doing the we're prepared as prepared for it as as you are, or as you were. But now coming into after post graduation, you had a graduation in July. Now take us to present day. I mean, you were in the fall of 2020 of the new school year has started, the school systems across America had basically scrambled to see what they would need to do coming into the August to the fall semester of 2020. It's my understanding that you have both hybrid, both physical and virtual students. So you have a hybrid situation. What is that? Like?

Andrew Marine  
It's chaos. It's so difficult to juggle all of these different roles at once. You can't do any one of them well. And that's very difficult for me because I want to do things with excellence in all that I do. And this current situation with what we have, even nine, almost nine weeks into it, I mean, total of eight weeks into it so far. It was overwhelming at first and eight weeks later, it's still overwhelming. And so it's it's not sustainable. As far as I'm concerned. There may be Some teachers that will be whiz bang at doing all of it together, I know that I will not. And so I'm going to share with you a little bit a little insight of what it looks like for me right now. For my traditional in class time, I do have two, well, actually two regular segments, a sections of Ivy Tech composition in the, in the high school. Those are dual credit courses. I also have two sections of interactive media, which that introduces students to all of the major some of the major programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, the, you know, documentation, software, print software, there's all kinds of different software's that they can work with Adobe Premiere, those are some of the basics that they learned in that class. And I've got two in class sections of that. And then I also have Radio TV course, which is dual credit as well. And so that's what they look like in traditional classroom. So that sounds like a lot there. And it is, is a lot of great in, in person instruction in learning going on. But I also have one section of my composition course that is hybrid, there are students in my classroom, about 19 of them in my classroom. And I say about 19, because that ebbs and flows, based on COVID-19. Sometimes students are in there, and sometimes they're out for 10 days. And so it does ebb and flow a little bit, not a whole lot I, I was actually surprised at how little ebb and flow there is there is but it's not too bad at this point. my online students in that same exact class time in that same place, here's how it works, we have a web x system going on. So it's very much like the zoom, only I have access to this camera that's in the back of my room that follows me, or at least it tries to follow me, because it's face recognition. And I'm wearing a mask. So it doesn't work most of the time. But it's there to work,

Greg Marine  
internet. So the thing that's supposed to protect your students from you having it in case you had it, and you don't want to breathe it into the air in your classroom is actually preventing the technology to follow you. The camera technology follow you throughout the classroom.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah, so some irony there,

Greg Marine  
you are more prepared than that camera was exactly.

Andrew Marine  
Now, the there's also an HDTV in the room, that I can put up a mosaic, or have the student unmute themselves, and it can show that one student up. And then all the others on the smaller box. I usually just do the mosaic so I can see them all and monitor them at the same time. Because part of my job now is to monitor the students who are at home to make sure that they're engaged with the learning. And so they have to have their camera on if their camera is not on. They're not present.

Greg Marine  
Interesting. Yeah. So very interesting.

Andrew Marine  
Yeah. So there can be disciplinary actions taken on the student who's not doing the right thing. Unfortunately, I've got senior, so in a college class, so it's not as much of a classroom management issue for me. But for those teachers that are doing the same thing with freshmen and sophomores. Yeah, there's been issues,

Greg Marine  
I can imagine Oh,

Andrew Marine  
and and, and, and those had to be taken care of with the assistant principal,

Greg Marine  
taking care of that. So in reality,

Andrew Marine  
it gets very weird when when you're dealing with a virtual and in class at the same time hybrid. Now, my job is not done there. I have some students in my interactive media class that are all online, they have to use that VM client and their Google Drive to make this work. Now, what I do is I have seven major projects, and I've created modules for those seven major projects. And each day in class, what I do is I will do a tutorial, a five minute tutorial during class in record myself online. And then I'll post it in Canvas in the module for that for that project. So there are certain elements that they have to meet and and show proficiency in. And I will do a tutorial for each one of those. And so, each day in class on each day, I will produce two of those because I have two interactive media courses, and then I'll upload them as we go. So students We'll only see half of them when they're in class. So that means they have to watch the videos on time.

Greg Marine  
Interesting.

Andrew Marine  
And so my in class and my out of class, you know, all my students are getting the content, they're just getting it at different times. Now, if that isn't weird enough, here's how my classes work. My in class students are synchronous, right? I have them third, and fourth and fifth periods. Well, they're able to do the seven projects asynchronously, I allow them to choose whichever ones they want to do at whichever time as long as you get all seven in, in this semester. my online students on the other hand, they're asynchronous, because they don't meet at a certain time with me, they can do it at any time during the day, right. But they all have to be synchronous with the project that we're doing.

Greg Marine  
Okay. And so,

Andrew Marine  
so it's, so what I do is I create the tutorials for the ones for the one that they're on. Or I try to get ahead of them, so that it's ready to go when it when I get I'm at the point now where I'm ahead of them. So the tutorials are ready for them when they start that project. So that's how I've learned to cope. And that's using technology to help instruct.

Greg Marine  
And it's interesting that you use the phrase or the word cope, you're coping just like every one of us has to cope with this, this interesting situations interesting year. One thing's for certain 100 years ago, when the last global pandemic occurred. We didn't have this technology. Back then we barely had the telephone, there wasn't even a television in every home. I'm not even sure radio was a was a big thing at the time. And so what we have today, to be able to cope, as you said, in this new day, and age is interesting technology, it could be far worse than it really is. And I'm glad to hear that you're able to work with these students, and be able to continue their education in spite of what's going on in the world today. And so one of the questions that I have for you, okay, it's October 2020. Where do you see technology going for the classroom?

Andrew Marine  
I see. The that WebEx classroom that I described where we're a hybrid in class and out of class, I know the school has invested in it. And that is something that I think will be an expectation for us going forward, that we will have an online student presence. But I think that that will be much smaller, going forward. After the pandemic is over. I imagine that more students will be in the classroom, physical classroom than out. And so will that technology become obsolete? follows a betting man, I'd say yes, in the next three years. It won't be in use, except for rare occasion. Because that splitting of the the classrooms, it's very difficult. I don't think that public education is going to be in the business of all online. And if it is, there will be a separate school for it within the public schools. that there will be some teachers that there's no going back now that they've tasted the waters of of all online, they'll want to continue doing that. And, and I think that the school, public schools will probably catch up a little bit with some of the private schools on that and use that in a smaller cluster. But it won't be a prominent one. I think the students who really thrive in an online environment, asynchronous environment, they're going to go to those. I don't think there'll be any stopping them at that point. But I don't think it's going to be in huge droves. I think we are social people. And to be social. I think a lot of a lot of students and I think a lot of teachers realized that lockdown. We can't sustain that for the long term. Do we want to be safe? Do we want to be healthy? Absolutely. But there is an understanding that if we were to stayed at home, another six months, there would have been some serious problems. And so I understand my role in in keeping education going in the classroom. You know, I know that will likely be two weeks too late, if we have to shut down. But I'm grateful that we do have the technologies that we have to be able to, to weather this pandemic. I've been paperless for a long time. But, you know, it's been over a decade now that I've been paperless. But I've got a few of my colleagues saying, you know, this is the first time I've ever had them submit papers digitally. And I kind of like it. I kind of like having my laptop as being the my stack of papers. I said, You're just a step away.

Greg Marine  
Let me know when you're ready, just to step off from having a e ink tablet in your hands, like you do.

Andrew Marine  
Yep. Yep. And so I said, let me know when you're ready. I'll, I'll give you my recommendation.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, so imagine someday that'll be one of the things on the budget for your type of physical school that you're you're a part of. So the course of your career from college to today, you went from a computer in the lobby of your dorm to check email, to now you have it on your phone, in your hand. Yeah. And then from analog, VHS tapes, when you started in broadcast journalism, to now fiber optics that allow you both video feeds, and communication to your camera operators. The technology that has grown over the course of that time, not only has helped you become a better educator, but it's also helped you be able to be that educator in 2020, where the craziness of the of the situation with a global pandemic has allowed you to be able to, even though it can be frustrating at times be able to work in a hybrid classroom where you've got students at home, students and physical, being able to do all of this

and not lose your mind.

However, in all that said and done. My final thoughts on this is what I'm taking away from what I'm hearing is it may not necessarily be sustainable. But the technologies that are being invented today will definitely shape our future. But at the end of the day, all of this is just an appliance, it's a tool. We are social people, we will get back to what is considered a normal someday. And these technologies will just help us get there. And so that's kind of my final thoughts. What what are your final thoughts on on what's happening today, here in October 2020. As we close out this year,

Andrew Marine  
we have a serious global crisis. And in the midst of that global crisis, we do have resources at our fingertips to help us cope with it as best as we can. And after this crisis is over, I think we'll all have grown from this, in that that's as people as consumers of content. And as producers of content. As I said at the beginning, I'm a composition just, I'm a storyteller, and the tools that we have before us. I'm excited. I'm excited to be able to tell amazing stories. And in my role as an educator, I'm able to bring a whole lot more people along with me to tell those stories. And that is exciting to me, and I thoroughly enjoy it. I enjoy bringing people along the journey to tell those stories. And so, technology, it's here to stay. I embrace it as it comes along. In the more in better ways of telling those stories, the better for me, and I enjoy it. Love it.

Greg Marine  
Well, Andrew, thank you so much for joining me today. Again, I've known you for four decades, for more than four decades. And I appreciate your insight into technology in today's classroom, and on behalf of as a parent, I want to thank you for what you do for students like my son and my sons, my stepsons. I appreciate everything you do. And thank you so much for coming on this episode of talking tech.

Andrew Marine  
My pleasure. Thank you.
