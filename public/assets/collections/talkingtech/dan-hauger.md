Do you know what happens behind the scenes when you call 911? Have you ever wondered how first responders work well under pressure? This week, we learn the answers to those questions and more as I chat with Dan Hauger, a firefighter and first responder. Welcome to talking tech.

Dan Hauger  
My name is Dan Hauger. I am a firefighter. I have been a firefighter for going on 20 years now. I have been involved in some of the trainings, some of the product development that we use for the fire department, and just an all around grunt. But other than that, I'm just what's called a blackhat. backseat. I do the work that needs to be done.

Greg Marine  
Excellent. Excellent. Well, thank you so much for being on the show today. On behalf of everyone, thank you for your service to the community as a first responder, you, you help save lives and and that greatly appreciate.

Dan Hauger  
Thank you.

Greg Marine  
And one of the reasons I am today is to talk about the technology that you deal with day in day out in the job. And I say day in and day out. You actually have a you go on shifts, 24 hour shifts. Tell us a little bit about that.

Unknown Speaker  
All right, not every fire schedule is the same. But the most common schedule is you work 24 hours on shift and you're off 48 hours. A lot of people look at that and think wow, you have two days off. Technically, yes. But the older you get that first day off of shift is a recovery day, depending on how how much time you spend out in the field the night before, I just got off shift this morning. And I think we got a total about three and a half hours of sleep last night, on and off. Multiple runs, different scenarios, different situations. But you get used to it after a while ish. But then the next day, but a lot of us will work a part time job on those two days off. So many times we'll work 24 hours go straight from our fire job to our part time job. And so I lovingly call those my 32 hour work days. Now, when we're on shift, we're not one runs. The whole shift. We're not out from the firehouse the whole shift. A lot of times there have been times that we have been but there are times to rest and eat occasionally. And very rarely we have times where we do not see our bunks until the very very end of the shift.

Greg Marine  
Now you said that you came off a shift this morning. So this is your recovery day. Today is my recovered and here you are recording a podcast.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, it this is a this is a pleasure. I'm glad I could help out. Not working a part time job right now is good. It was a choice. My wife and I made for me to prepare for my retirement coming up in a few years.

Greg Marine  
Okay, speaking of retirement, what do you plan to do in retirement?

Unknown Speaker  
my retirement plans. I am a musician, I'm a trumpet player. Prior to being a firefighter, I was a school teacher. I was a band director. So I'm very heavily involved in music. I plan on upon retirement, or planning on moving down to Florida and I will be going back into music full time playing my horn, possibly teaching and working for either Disney universal freelance work, basically being a trumpet player and getting a tan. Oh, very nice.

Greg Marine  
That'll be a good retirement, I think I think you mentioned that Disney universal. That's one of the passions that you have is Walt Disney. And it is the parks and the movies and and basically the lifestyle that comes with being a Disney fan.

Dan Hauger  
Right?

Greg Marine  
Right. So yeah, that'll be that'll be fun. And But before that, you're still going to be a firefighter for a couple more years. So tell us a little bit about some of the technology with stuff by talking about some of the newer stuff. Today's age, there's a lot of digital software and stuff like that that goes into any kind of industry but in this case, what kind of tools do you have at your disposal? When it comes to

Unknown Speaker  
smartphones are one of the one of the things that for for us from it that that is one of the newer things is our dispatch. Typically what would happen is when a person worked a call, when a person calls 911 they talk to another person. Okay? They get that person gets them. They put them on hold, then they dispatch us. And we have a verbal dispatch, for example, what would happen is, let's say my son fell and hurt his ankle. I would call 911911 dispatcher would say, what's what's going on? This is a total paraphrase. And this is not how it really happens, what's going on, hey, my son hurt his ankle, what is your address 123 North Main Street, okay, stay on the line while I dispatch someone, then that person would get flipped, which is how we like to flip a switch, and then dispatch the fire. So the tones of our house, then that person would actually say engine one, medic 1123 North Main Street for an injured person into one medic, one North Main Street for injured person. How that has changed is we now have gone totally digital. And we have what we lovingly call digital Debbie. Just okay. So what happens if someone calls 911 they are talking to a person, as they're that person is getting the information, they're punching into the computer, hit send, and then a digital voice will dispatch us, okay to that address telling us what's going on. While the human person is still talking to the person online giving them direction giving them instruction, if they need it, be that shock management, CPR. You know, dislodging something by doing what has changed the Heimlich maneuver, but they change that. So they are actually still having that contact. And many times we get there when they're still talking to the person online. Very cool. And so they can dispatch multiple companies without having to break contact with a person.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, that sounds very interesting. What used to be where they had to break contact, now they can continue stay in contact with the the injured person or the person taking care of them right without without having to disconnect. And then that kind of hopefully makes it go by quicker, but also eases the, the panic.

Unknown Speaker  
That that's one of the things that we have developed as fire companies, we practice so many different types of scenarios and things one of the ones we do is called a mayday drill, where if I get separated from my company, I get into have no idea where I am column A through my radio, we all carry radios. And then what happens is, other companies will hear what's going on. But one person who's in charge of that that scene will maintain contact with that person and tell them don't worry, we're sending people your way. Can you look around, see where you are. And so that one on one contact is a way to keep that person calm. And so that is carried over to our fireground operations. Very nice. Yeah.

Greg Marine  
And that makes me feel even better. I've never had to go in the event that I have to now I know with confidence that I'll still be talking with the 911 dispatcher, because they're just pushing buttons and it's all being electronically sent. Exactly to your location. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  
one of my favorite stories ever. I, you know, we joke about many, many things. But we got dispatched to a car accident and one of my partners at the time, the guy is as big as a house. We go up to this guy in a car, he's still on the phone. And he sees people that got hurt in the accident. windows are still up. So my partner knocks on the window and says hey, roll down your window and open your door and knock it the guy looked at him said I'm on the phone with 911 my partner didn't kindly says some 911 so that was one of our funny stories. True story. And it really reminded me of Princess Bride. When Andre the Giant says I'm on the brute squad and Billy Crystal says you are the brute squad. Because that that was very appropriate.

Greg Marine  
That is a funny story. Now, as far as technology that's been carried over throughout the decades, some of the technology that I'm interested to hear about are things like what was called Jaws of Life and all that kind of stuff. That's technology to it may not be controlled by computers. But tell me a little bit about some of the equipment that you use to help get into vehicles or if you're at a house to buy a house or certifiers

Unknown Speaker  
handle including extrication tools, breaching tools, even hose lines and we just got new technology on our upper Ryder day for our department. We got new new nozzles for hoses. There are different types of nozzles, different companies, different beliefs in which kind you should use because they're The nozzles that are called combination nozzles where you can turn the nozzle one way and it creates a what's called a fog stream or fog becomes a fog nozzle, you can turn it another way becomes a straight stream, the kind we have are called solid bore nozzles. And the best way to describe that is if you were to go to any type of amusement park or guess or or Disney or whatever, you see these fountains with the solid streams of water shooting up in the air, right? It's that concept, the tighter the the water that we have, the easier it is for us to control and to go where we aim. The new nozzles we have now is new technology that we didn't create. They were created in laboratory or with scientists for people who are much smarter than what we are. But we know how to use that. And what happens is, the more water we're pushing out of that nozzle, the faster we can get the fire out better control, but the vote these nozzles in such a way that is putting less pressure back on us. So we can advance the hose a lot quicker and a lot easier to go through a house because many times we'll do training, try to simulate a house. And we cannot do it in a way that simulates every house because some people may have a couch right in the front doorway that we will have to go around. Some people may have just a long line of empty space that we can just take the hose right through. The less pressure we have in that hose, the easier it is to bend it around things. So they think they take that consider create the technology. But that's that's our newest, newest thing. you'd mentioned Jaws of Life. Jaws of Life is actually a brand name and I was very clear. I'm going to be very careful at not mentioning brand names. Initially I since I just got off shift like yesterday, I was looking at a lot of the things that we use the different tools we use and decided I'm not going to write anything down because I do not want to bring a name and make it sound like I'm endorsing. But extrication tools, we do have cutters and spreaders and we have Rams. There there. There are different tools for different functions. I the last two years, I have been at a firehouse where I'm on an engine now and my house does not have any extrication capabilities. For the last 15 years I was on the extrication team at the Firehouse and so my job was the spreaders. I was the spreaders guy, my partner's job was the cutters. spreaders are what many people call the jaws of life. Okay. The original spreaders that that you could see on old old pictures are hydraulic spreaders. Okay, well, we still use hydraulic spreaders, but the difference is back then they use a hand pump. Okay, that doesn't spread. Now we have either a small compact pump that we that's ran by gas, or we pull the hoses straight off of a truck and use the hydraulics from that. And we're able to use the the spreaders and the cutters. And each spreader and cutter have different torque amounts and they vary from manufacturer they vary from size, because you might get a set of spreaders that you know weigh significantly more than other that cannot spread as much because of the design. So that is another thing that that we have. Always wise open for things like that. more torque, more ability to to spread things with the new technology in vehicles with the new metals that are being used. The metals do not cut like they used to. They shatter and add a force for them to shatter. And a lot of the tools that we carry will not cause them to shatter. So we have to reconfigure our thinking and thinking what do we need to move. So if you're involved in a vehicle where we have to what we lovingly call cut you out.

Unknown Speaker  
That is where I really had a forgiving for things. I had a lot of fun, because I'm a puzzle guy. Sure. And if I said you were trapped right there and the dashboards down on your legs and your legs or ankles that they shouldn't be, I have to move that dashboard in a way to keep your legs from getting crushed even more I have to keep you as comfortable as I can and move everything else away. And that's that's what we do. So that that technology has improved over the years since I I've been on in 20 years significantly different size of ramps and use a ram to let's say the roof is crushed down. You can put a ram on the floorboard, extend and start pushing that roof up to give more headroom, things like it's just the only limit is your imagination many times but You start to use a safely why you can't use a ram for something that you need to use cutters for.

Greg Marine  
And that's actually one of the you mentioned you kind of have some fun with it. Loosely you say that but at the same time, that's the type of person that I would want coming rescue me because you're a puzzle, you'll be like puzzles and trying to navigate through a fire smoke. Or if it's an accident, the the different angles at which the metal is been bent. You have to work through that. So one way, I think it would take the kind of mindset to be able to say, Okay, here's a puzzle, how am I going to do this to most effectively do it and find the right tools to make that happen? Right?

Unknown Speaker  
Right. If the team I was on we were a team, typically, when how we operate, one crew takes one side of the vehicle, the other crew takes the other side of the vehicle and my crew would take the primary side. If it was just a driver, we take driver side. Sure, they will, the other team will start coming up with Plan B. If our plan A is not working, they're ready for Plan B, we step back, we start coming up with a plan C or D. Because in that that's the way we operated. Many times. We would adjust Plan A to become plan 8.1. Plan A. But when we would practice what would happen is we'd go to junkyards and the junkyards that allow us to come in and practice wonderful people, they had more almost more fun than we did, because they would come in with their fork trucks with cars. And we would say, hey, look, turn, you know, inverted, smashed up on the roof, this this with a side thing here, let's put the dummy in there. Because we would put dummies inside the car. That's the driver go at it, and they would ram cars together and stack them and do different things like that. And then we'd have competitions, we'd have two scenarios set up exactly the same way. When you mark, get set, go and do the other crew would go at it and see who can get the patient out. Not only the fastest, but with the least damage to the patient, or dummy. And we had certain we had worked together for so long, and it worked so, so well that we became silent. few words were passed between us because we knew what the next step be when we always had our tools in ready position. And when a tool would fail, because it's technology technology fails. We had the third person reading or sending our crew was always or officer he typically would step back. Fortunately, all three of us were at the level, we could sit back and assess the situation and give instruction. So my tool would fail, I'd step back, my officer would step in with the tool, I get another tool Get ready, give instruction if needed to be but we were we were pretty much in a quiet way. And we would hear the the other guys who many times were the younger bulls that, you know, beat their chest and gave some grunts over there telling each other what they needed to do and this and that. And by the time we had the whole side of the car off, they were just opening up the front door. A little bit of an exaggeration, but not too much of an exaggeration in that. But when one piece of technology that was used in still is used more, let me rephrase that. There's a piece of technology that was used way before I got on the fire department that basically one person or two people mad and that was the radio. If you remember the old TV show emergency, okay, Johnny and Roy would contact the hospital through their police. Basically they had a suitcase and that's how they contact hospital. Now, everybody carries a radio, okay, and we haven't on straps with a lapel mic, we can talk to a hospital we can talk to dispatch, we can talk to one another we can talk to command, we can basically talk to anybody that we need to and that is the technology has improved our fireground operations immensely a fire ndms One of the things that each radio has is a panic button. Okay, and so if I get it put in a situation in a fight, I can hit that panic button, it clears everything out and just has an open channel for me and roll and they can hear what's going on. I can do my Mayday if I need to. Or if I'm in a situation. I'm in a house medical situation. And

Unknown Speaker  
something happens that doesn't need to happen and I'm in imminent danger I can hit the panic button and it knows exactly where I am and knows my address and will immediately if I do not respond back they immediately Sending officers and things like that vary. And so it kind of gives you a little bit of security. Sure, a little bit more security, I guess you could say, well, that's good because then you don't that's one less thing you have to worry about. As you're going into a situation, we we still are concerned our heads on a swivel. But many times we do get into situations where we are told seen as not safe wait for police. Okay. So our relationship with police officers are, it's a valuable relationship. It's, it's a symbiotic relationship. And we converse with them on radios do we just go to different channels, we can talk to the police officers. And that's really valuable in Swat situations, when there are SWAT situations, we will show up there and be in staging with a SWAT team, and we have communications with them.

Greg Marine  
Now we'll be in movies, paint a different picture of that, that, that that is really neat. I didn't realize that, that your communicate that efficiently with the other first responders really cool.

Unknown Speaker  
And our radios are digital now. And that was an interesting switch. We went from analog to digital and just like with anything else with the fire department, any change, you're going to have your guys that grumble and complain about it. They're like, there was no need, it worked really, really well. And, and we're happy with the change.

Greg Marine  
Very cool. Very cool. Now what is one technology over the course of the last 20 years, made the most improvement, it sounds like radios have Is there any other technologies that have made a vast improvement in the evolution,

Unknown Speaker  
I would have to say, our own board computers, we did out with for my career, we started out with these little yellow screen monitors, and keyboards that you would receive, where you are going the coordinates because every thing is on a coordinate system. If you live on Main Street, that's usually zero, east and west, or north and south. If you live like meridian stream, zero, east, west, north south, and then you go coordinates down that way. 100, South is one block that and things like that, right. And that's what we would get 123 Main Street 100 South 20 West,

Greg Marine  
okay,

Unknown Speaker  
like that. That was the information we got. And when you needed to information, your times because right when you get in the truck, you hit f4, which means you're responding f5 you're on scene f8, you're back in service. And if there are any other firefighters going to listen to this, I am just those are numbers I'm just making up out of my head because it changes for everybody. And those, it's been so long. So we use them, I can't remember what numbers we use. But now we actually have laptops, okay. And on our laptops, what will happen is we get dispatched for one, it will not only have the address, it will have the coordinates it will have what's going on if our scene is safe last night, or I should say, I think it was like 330 this morning 530 this morning is actually when this was it said garage door will be open, the garage door was not open. So the officer was able to contact control controls, they will call them like hey, they're there, they can't get in. And the reason why we had to go through the garage door is because the injured patient was laying by the front door wouldn't meet it. And so we had communication like that. But sometimes they will have the garage door code for us. It will also give us information prior run. So let's say I'm going to your house, it might give me information of pre run patient stated key was in this lockbox with this code, okay? You didn't give them that information that time, but they were able to pull that up, which will then help us to get to the house. Because if you're not letting us in, and we can look through a window and see in your unconscious we stopped to get in, right? We do not want to break anything. Sure we love breaking things, but we do not want to break anything. So if we look at that information, go to the key code, punch it in without breaking anything, we will do that. Okay. Another thing will also give us his maps. Oh, and we do turn by turn directions. But there are still glitches in that picture. In one of the things that we we laugh about. Due to the fact that I'm on the southwest side of Indianapolis, we might get a dispatch to a run. And it will say that the run is actually on the northeast side of Indianapolis about 25 miles away. And we know that's not true. Okay, because we know address. And we know it's only two miles away from us. Okay. Yeah. So we still have those that we still work through, but that's just part of the good

Greg Marine  
and that'll change over time. it'll improve it will.

Unknown Speaker  
It will another part of that his cell phones are battalion chiefs have a cell phone behind cell phone, and what will happen on scenes, what they cannot put on a screen, because a lot of that information is, you know, anybody can see if it's sensitive, they will actually call the battalion chief and say, Hey, we have this going on in an example of that is if we have a patient that was going mental, emotional patients at times, we're not going to go there and try to excite the patient in a way to cause them more harm, or anguish or anything like that. They will call the battalion chief, a battalion chief, especially that run and say, Hey, this is what's going on. Here are a few triggers, here's what usually come just to let you know, the battalion chief with information to us. And an example of the importance of cell phones, and happened to us yesterday. And due to HIPAA, I cannot give very specific things. But what I can say is, we were in a situation where the patient was injured in an area off the grid. So one of our crew members pulled up his cell phone, got on the maps, did a pin drop of where we were took a screenshot and send the battalion who was outside of the area, the battalion was able to use that get on a four by four, and bring the other crews to us, we were able to load up the patient, get them out of out of the area, right. So we were able to do that we were not able to access that on our computers on the effects because the trucks were parked away from the scene, okay. But we will use the computers in the mapping system for that too. And especially with us, because many times we go on runs outside of our normal fire area. And so my officers given our driver, just say by play, when you get up here, you're going to turn a right second turn left. And that should be a dirt road here or let's say a gravel road that turns into a pavement here. And he can see that off the mapping.

Greg Marine  
Very cool.

Unknown Speaker  
It is it is cool. It's nice. It's really nice. Because one of the funny things that I always heard growing up for my dad, he would say, look at those idiots, my dad's works. Look at those idiots, they don't even know where they're going when you have to fire him or the ambulance or the ladder trucks. And when I got on the department, I told Dad, I said, Dad, they're going where they're told me to go. And that changes when we're on our way there. And so this has actually come down a little bit of the confusion of where to go. And also with going back to what I really said, with a dispatcher still talking to the person they can update and we get updates continually. Which is really, really nice.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, they can update you while they're still talking to him. patient.

Dan Hauger  
Nice. It has helped us tremendously.

Greg Marine  
Very cool.Very cool.

That's very fascinating. And I appreciate the insight into the technology that goes into being a first responder and saving lives. And earlier this year, because of the COVID pandemic, there was it wasn't necessarily a shortage of personal protection equipment as much as it was the need skyrocketed compared. And one of the things that you and I had to work with was we have a 3d printing business. And so we work with you and your, your department to get some of that 3d printed, right compete available to you guys. And so can you tell me about that and, and that equipment was used? Right?

Unknown Speaker  
It was interesting, because along with every part of government, no matter how big or small, there's a bureaucracy and many times you'll get things in it will be shelved. However with the items that you made for us, which we greatly appreciate, they were used immediately, they were dispatched to the different houses face shields in, in the holders for for masks and it was credible because instead of the things being instead of service receiving the items and being told well, you'll get them when you need them. The need was immediate, it was given to us it was dispatched to us and it was used almost instantly. Whatever run because still on runs, now we are wearing masks, be it the cloth masks or the N 95 masks, the shields, the ones that you made. Those are now our protection when we are doing cardiac arrests to protect our or wholesales or faces from bodily fluids or if there are any any other type of trauma things We still have some that we are using for those situations.

Greg Marine  
Very nice.

Dan Hauger  
So we appreciate it. Thank you so much. Oh,

Greg Marine  
you're welcome. It was those times were like, what, what can we do? And that was one of the suggestions when we were looking at the forums for printers. And now we've got, we have 10 printers that were pumping out this PP and so it was easy to make hundreds we made hundreds of face masks, we made over 5000 year guards for the masks. So it was it was a it was a challenging time for the for the community around us. And so we were so glad that it went directly to helping save lives here in the Indianapolis area, especially here in South Southwestern. So.

Unknown Speaker  
Now,

Greg Marine  
aside from the technology that we've talked about here in first responding and firefighting, the things that brought us together was disc golf, right. And before we met, you are already playing it. So what got you into the leisure of outside of your job to wind down and play this thing called disc golf.

Unknown Speaker  
My family and I were attending mountain Gilliam church in Morrisville. And one morning when we arrived, I noticed a basket, a disc golf basket. And I had seen it before. I had thrown a frisbee at one before sure, but never played around a disc off. And I told my wife Hey, that's fun. That'd be fun for us to get him. I think we'd like to do that. So my birthday, it was close to my birthday. So for my birthday, I got a starter pack. Okay, that came with a driver, a mid range and a putter. So our first round of disc golf My wife is not a disc golf person. She she's decided that it's not her her bag, she came out and tried to play with us and she said no. But my son, my daughter and I went out and played around the desk off and I had this great idea of not knowing anything about disc golf, per se. I had this great idea was okay first hole, you throw this disc, you throw this, this and this disc, okay? And so that led to a little bit of frustration when this would have to tee off with a putter okay, because our beginning our beginning drives with typical drives of a new person playing disc golf where they go straight up and come right back down, right. And with a putter it even less distance than the driver with my daughter decided it was okay. But it's not her bag, either. My son and I, we started drooling when we realized this is fun. Yeah, we get to walk we get to throw things in and have a blast. And so then that started our disc golf adventure and about, I'm just going to guess and say let's just say 30 discs each later, we now know the difference between a driver putter mid range.

Greg Marine  
And the to explain this to some of the listeners who may never have heard of this golf or didn't know what it was. Basically the the rim of the desk is a different shape for different types of throws, and says that you can throw a disc and it's like a typical frisbee that you would just toss to your dog or back and forth at the beach. You know a driver is more streamlined, thin on the edge can cut through the air as it's spinning, whereas a putter is very dull on the edge and is designed to grab the chains of the basket. And so the mid range of course is different shapes on the on the edge to have it go certain directions as you're throwing it with it left or right or depending on the spin that you give it. Just like ball golf, you

Unknown Speaker  
have your your Woods your irons and your putters, right. And that's what we have there. It's just the carts that that people use in disc golf for the kind you pull behind it. Not the kind you're right in such a big difference.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, this is good exercise, which is actually what got me into it to begin with is I needed to lose weight. And then I heard about this. This league and Mongolia. I joined it met you guys.

Unknown Speaker  
So for now, but you can't get rid of this and I

Greg Marine  
can't get rid of you.

Unknown Speaker  
And that's all right. Yeah.

Greg Marine  
And we also share our love for Disney. Not to go into too much detail. But one of the things that we use there from technology is my Disney experience, the app and one of the things I find interesting about you is that you have the app installed, not just for Walt Disney or you. Right You also have the parks in other countries and California, right so you can see the wait times of all the parks that

Unknown Speaker  
I am a self professed geek. I love it. And I also found out that another guy that I'm on the fire department with is also a Disney freak. And his name's Brandon and Brandon, Brandon and I have some good conversations about about Disney. And he's a great firefighter, great guy. And we've talked about the different apps too, and in his kids love Disney, and so on. So I say no, wait time. Shanghai right now is outside that the morning he just shakes his head because he comes in as I'm condemned for his shift as I'm getting off shift. So yeah, my geekness will cause some head shaking and things like that. Yeah, I it's interesting. I like I like looking at the different layouts of the lands and the different ways that they present the same story.

Greg Marine  
And then 10 years ago, we didn't have that, right. Like these apps were just being introduced, let's say about nine to 10 years ago, but it wasn't across every Park. So right. It was very fascinating the difference now that you can have that Disney magic in your pocket, yep. Regardless where you are, where you are in the world.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah. And what's interesting, also, going to Disney and doing a bridge between Disney and in the fire department. We, part of our another part of our technology that we use at the fire department is we have different detectors. So might have a co detector we might have, we have sectors, and we have thermal imaging cameras, where we use in situations where we need to find heat signatures within a fire for bodies or hidden fires and things like that. But we got called for carbon monoxide in the home, there are carbon monoxide detectors going off. And so we arrived and, and the homeowner was standing outside with four kids, a husband was at work. And as we started talking, you know, button, the monitors calibrate outside, come to find out she was a Disney freak, which was pretty nice. And so I was able to talk to her about Disney the whole time while her house is getting checked out. Yeah. And so the technology of the fire department was being used inside the technology of Disney was being talked about outside and forth, we were able to find the leak to the help of the gas company and, and in able to take care of the bad situation that could have happened. Yeah. But through Disney and in the technology of Disney talking about the differences between the technology technology they use in California and Lando kept her nice and calm and collected. Well, the technology we use to save their lives were being administered inside the house.

Greg Marine  
That is very cool. Very interesting. Awesome. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
I am, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it. The the new, I'm calling them toys that we have. I just said we got a grant to get new co detectors, so all of our products are gonna have co detectors again. Because what will happen just like anything else that uses that test, air filters will go bad internal filters will go bad. So if you are wondering if you should change your, your smoke detector, it has filters, change it, if you're wondering, they're relatively cheap, or you can a lot of times you can get ahold of your fire department and say, Hey, I need new smoke detectors. And many times they're free. And how we do it is if you contact the headquarters will come out and install them may just put them up right back up where the old ones were, because there are specific areas that where you want to. But if you've ever had a fire in your house or anything like that, that filter is probably has some some residual smoke or Ash on it and it would need to be replaced. So

Greg Marine  
that's good advice. Very good.

Unknown Speaker  
Technology, technology will will save you or cause you to scratch your head and go What am I doing here?

Greg Marine  
Well, thanks. Thankfully the technology we've been talking about today is mostly the good kind of saving. Exactly. So versus the scratching head kind so yeah, no, that's great. And I appreciate your time today, Dan, and thank you again for for your service to our community. Thank you and, and everything like that. So thank you for being on the show.
