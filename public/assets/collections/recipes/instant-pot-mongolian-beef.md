# Overview

When you have a picky eater in the family, it is tough to find something everyone will like. Well, this Mongolian Beef recipe was a crowd pleaser! Even the picky eater loved it. With the same quality and flavor of what I have only been able to get from a fancy Asian restaurant, I was impressed with how easy it is to make this delicious meal.

# Instructions

1. Set your Instant Pot to Saute for 9 minutes on high; while its preheating, coat your sliced sirloin with corn starch. Add 2 tbsp of peanut oil in the pot, and add sirloin, garlic, shallots, ginger, sesame oil, and hot chili oil. Stir until browned.
2. Pour in Pacific Foods Organic Beef Broth, soy sauce, and brown sugar; stir until evenly mixed. Put the lid on the instant pot, then set to Pressure Cooker (manual mode on older IPs) for 10 minutes on high.
3. While pressure cooking, slice your carrots and mushroom; chop broccoli and green onion. Take instant ramen noodles out of packet, tossing the flavor packet.
4. Release pressure from instant pot and remove lid when safe to do so. Set to saute and bring to a boil. Add ramen noodles, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, and optionally Pacific Foods Organic Beef Broth if you want a soupier ramen bowl. Cook for about 3 minutes, then set to warm.
5. Serve with green onion, toasted sesame seeds, and any other additional toppings you like. Tip: try bean sprouts, green bell peppers or even a little cilantro. Enjoy!
