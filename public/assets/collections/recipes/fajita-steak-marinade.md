# Overview

This recipe makes an excellent marinade for steak fajitas. I made this for a Father's Day dinner at my in-laws. Not only was it a hit, it was the preferred protein of that meal over my fajita chicken and fajita shrimp!

# Notes

Flank or skirt steak is best for fajitas. However, sirloin cut into strips will also work.
