# Instructions

1. Bake red velvet cupcakes according to package instructions and set aside to cool.
2. Either bake the sugar cookies, if you decide to make homemade cookies, or prepare store bought cookies by taking them out of the packaging.
3. Get the buttercream frosting. You can either buy pre-made frosting or you can make your own.
4. Finely ground Oreos in a food processor.
5. Mix finely ground Oreos into the buttercream frosting in a large bowl until completely incorporated.
6. Put raspberry jam in a frosting bag, piping bag, or ziplock bag with a small hole in the corner.
7. Add a small dab of jam to the center of the sugar cookies. This helps glue the cupcake to the cookie.
8. Place a cupcake on each cookie
9. Top the cookie with another dab of raspberry jam.
10. Place your whipped chocolate Oreos frosting into a piping bag and swirl over the cupcakes in a cone shape.

# Notes

The grey stuff is a great dessert by itself, without the cookie, cupcake, or raspberry jam.
