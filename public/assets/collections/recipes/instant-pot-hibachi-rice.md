# Overview

Asian cooking is quite fascinating to me and I really love cooking this wonderful food. Japanese cuisine is by far one of my favorites. I love sashimi, nigiri, sushi, and hibachi. This Instant Pot (pressure cooker) rice will make you feel like you are at a hibachi grill as much as it does me!

# Ingredients

# Instructions

1. Turn on saute mode of your Instant Pot or pressure cooker.
2. Crack open the eggs and whisk until egg whites are well blended with the yokes.
3. Once the pot is hot add the butter and onions. For mine, it is usually within 5 minutes. Your speed may vary.
4. Saute onions until golden.
5. Add garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.
6. Add eggs, water, and soy sauce (in that order) and mix well.
7. Add rice and mix well again.
8. If your Instant Pot or pressure cooker has a rice setting, use that.
   - If there isn't a rice setting, set pressure to low and cook for about 10 minutes.
9. Once cooking finishes, allow to naturally release completely.
10. Fluff rice with a fork and serve.
