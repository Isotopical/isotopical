# Overview

This recipe makes an excellent marinade for shrimp street tacos. This started as shrimp fajitas and therefore will work for that as well. However, street tacos are a favorite entree in my household. So, that is what I'll stick to for the title of this recipe!

# Notes

This recipe works well for fajitas as well. For vegetables, I would use the bell peppers and onions. Street tacos work will with coleslaw mix.
