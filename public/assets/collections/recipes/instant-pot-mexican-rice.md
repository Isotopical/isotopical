# Overview

My family loves Mexican food. Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and rice. If it was created south of our southern border, they will eat it! Inspired by the [Instant Pot Hibachi Rice](/recipes/instant-pot-hibachi-rice), this Mexican rice recipe is extremely easy to make and is sure to please.

# Instructions

1. Turn on saute mode of your Instant Pot or pressure cooker.
2. Once the pot is hot add the butter and onions. For mine, it is usually within 5 minutes. Your speed may vary.
3. Saute onions until golden.
4. Add garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.
5. Add chicken broth, cumin, cilantro, and tomato sauce (in that order) and mix well.
6. Add rice and mix well again.
7. If your Instant Pot or pressure cooker has a rice setting, use that.
   - If there isn't a rice setting, set pressure to low and cook for about 10 minutes.
8. Once cooking finishes, allow to naturally release completely.
9.  Fluff rice with a fork and serve.
